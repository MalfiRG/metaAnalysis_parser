## Description

As the title says. Adapted from [Habanero Project](https://github.com/sckott/habanero).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need Python 3.8 or later to run this project. You can check your Python version by running:

```bash
python --version
```

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

To create a virtual environment, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

This will create a new virtual environment in a folder named `.venv`. To activate the virtual environment, run:

On Windows:
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

On Unix or MacOS:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

You should now see `(.venv)` at the beginning of your command line prompt, indicating that you are working inside the virtual environment. 

### Installing Dependencies

The project dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To install these dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
