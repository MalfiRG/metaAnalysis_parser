        we still got time for sustainability and reasonable application of ideas of
        sustainable development? It has been just over twenty years since the Brundtland
        Commission Report but, taken as an axiological term; sustainable development
        resonates with older historical horizons. At the heart of a long running history
        we are beginning to articulate more or less sustaining relationships between
        man and nature. We have described the (human) needs in the environmental,
        economic and social dimension of sustainable development to show some amazing
        shift in perception of sustainable development from local to global level.
        We are convinced that historical lesson of sustainable development shows there
        is no more time for sustainability, but time for SOStainability. Our proposed
        S-O-S in SOStainability means Save Our Sustainability! SOStainability represents
        the need to end the compromise between economic development and natural life

        on a long-term development of the selected Slovak cultural landscape types
        (plains, basins, uplands, highlands, and mountains) in approx. 200 years,
        which shaped the main land use features as well as on the recent transformation
        trends. The land use development analyses showed that from a long term view
        perspective several distinct periods can be distinguished. Each of these periods
        was characteristic for certain land use changes depending both on the landscape
        character or the socioeconomic situation. The recent trends as land use intensification
        (intense agriculture, sub-urbanisation, industrial construction) or land use
        extensification (agricultural land overgrowing) are considered to be common
        for the entire Slovak territory. Special transformation trends reflect more
        local conditions, human needs and preferences (construction of water reservoirs,
        wind calamities or tourism resorts) and though they are spatially isolated
        and small they influence the majority of Slovak inhabitants.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.2478\/v10285-012-0018-z","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,10]],"date-time":"2012-08-10T09:14:38Z","timestamp":1344590078000},"page":"41-55","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":16,"title":["Transformation

        (i.e. site conditions) were developed based on Kolesnikov''s topogenetic classification
        approach in Angara region (Central Siberia). This classification considers
        characteristics of forest regeneration dynamics, such as trends and rates
        of forest regeneration succession in a range of site conditions; therefore,
        it is used as a basis of a key for a forest regeneration dynamics map. An
        algorithm of forest regeneration dynamics mapping based on a spatial analysis
        of multi-band satellite data, a digital elevation model (DEM), and ground
        data combined with expert estimates of the resulting land cover classes was
        applied using geographic information system (GIS) \"Forests of Central Siberia\".
        Based on this algorithm, Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite imagery, SRTM-3- DEM, and
        field data were processed for the Angara test site. The resulting maps include
        two polygonal vector layers: one is forest regeneration stages (stand types)
        and the other is forest succession series (forest types) in a range of site
        conditions.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.2478\/v10285-012-0033-0","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,10]],"date-time":"2012-08-10T09:15:57Z","timestamp":1344590157000},"page":"42-54","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["A

        aim of this paper is to describe the species biodiversity of important woody
        species in the riparian zone of wide floodplains in the Protected Landscape
        Area (PLA) Pood\u0159\u00ed (Central Europe, Czech Republic). The analysis
        of growth in terms of particular species was carried out to find out their
        growth potential. Another task was to evaluate the diversity and health condition
        of all trees and to determine the occurrence frequency of important woody
        species (IWS) in particular geobiocoene type groups of wide alluvial plains.
        The tree classification pyramid (veteran-representative-successor-expectant)
        was built up to provide the sufficient number of diverse IWS in the area.
        In total, 3,419 IWS were mapped in the whole area of the PLA Pood\u0159\u00ed
        (81.5 km<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup>). In wide alluvial plains, the <jats:italic>Ulmi-fraxineta
        carpini sup.<\/jats:italic> geobiocoene type group (GTG) shows the highest
        diversity. According to the surveys carried out in the area under investigation
        it is evident that there are a lot of IWS here deserving protection and the
        proposal of the appropriate management, which should be represented by the
        pyramid mentioned above. The pyramid would provide protection and care for
        the registered trees to reach a respectable age and maximum dimensions. It
        is necessary to preserve the species spectrum of the IWS to maintain the gene
        pool of initial populations and biodiversity in landscape. Some species exceed
        growth parameters of the same species at other floodplain sites in the Czech
        Republic and even in Europe.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.2478\/v10285-012-0014-3","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,10]],"date-time":"2012-08-10T09:14:42Z","timestamp":1344590082000},"page":"57-75","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Important

        the Precautionary Principle in Designing and Managing Natura 2000 Areas (Exemplified
        by the Conservation of the Butterfly <jats:italic>Maculinea Nausithous<\/jats:italic>
        in a Rural Landscape North of Dresden (Saxony))<\/jats:title>\n        <jats:p>The
        precautionary principle is more and more incorporated into national law and
        decision-making on natural resource management and biodiversity conservation.
        In the coherent European network of protected areas Natura 2000, the precautionary
        principle finds expression in the obligation to provide favourable conditions
        for the long-term survival of species and habitats, especially of the priority
        ones listed in the annexes of the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive.
        After describing principles, structure, implementation and procedures of this
        rather new instrument for nature conservation using the example of one of
        the various Natura 2000 areas in Saxony (Germany), opportunities and problems
        for biodiversity conservation are outlined with particular regard for the
        situation in an agricultural landscape. Special attention is given to the
        following questions: requirements of and actual threats to the target species
        (the butterfly <jats:italic>Maculinea nausithous<\/jats:italic>), legal means
        and economic incentives for suitable measures, the management plan, and the
        role of stakeholders. It turns out that Natura 2000 could be an effective
        tool to advance nature conservation, and with special regard to the precautionary
        principle. Every effort is necessary to gain more public acceptance of Natura
        2000, as well as to improve scientific knowledge concerning species and habitats
        under protection.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.2478\/v10285-012-0002-7","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,10]],"date-time":"2012-08-10T09:13:33Z","timestamp":1344590013000},"page":"14-22","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Adopting

        and Landscapes - A Critical Comparative Appraisal<\/jats:title><jats:p>Ecosystems
        and landscapes are the two major spatial units for ecological research and
        practice, but their definitions and meanings are vague and ambiguous. Examining
        critically the meaning and complexity of both terms from a holistic landscape
        ecological systems view, the confusing applications of the ecosystem concept
        could be avoided by conceiving ecosystems as functional interacting systems,
        characterized for the flow of energy, matter and information between organisms
        and their abiotic environment. As functional systems they are intangible with
        vaguely defined borders. On the other hand, landscapes should be recognized
        as tangible, spatially and temporally well defined ecological systems of closely
        interwoven natural and cultural entities of the Total Human Ecosystem. Ranging
        from the smallest discernable landscape cell or ecotope to the global ecosphere,
        they serve as the spatial and functional matrix and living space for all organisms,
        including humans, their populations and their ecosystems. Both are medium-numbered
        complex ecological systems. However, the organized complexity of ecosystems
        is based solely on the monodimensional complexity of material processes of
        flow of energy\/matter and biophysical information. But the organized complexity
        of landscapes is multidimensional and multifunctional, dealing not only with
        the functional dimensions of natural bio-ecological processes and the natural
        biophysical information, but also with the cognitive mental and perceptual
        dimensions, transmitted by cultural information and expressed in the closely
        interwoven natural and cultural landscape.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.2478\/v10285-012-0024-1","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,10]],"date-time":"2012-08-10T09:14:42Z","timestamp":1344590082000},"page":"64-81","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":12,"title":["Ecosystem

        of microbial communities via metagenomic shotgun sequencing has enabled researches
        to gain unprecedented insight into microbial community structure and the functional
        roles of community members. This study describes a method and basic analysis
        for a metagenomic adaptation of the double digest restriction site associated
        DNA sequencing (ddRADseq) protocol for reduced representation metagenome profiling.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title><jats:p>This
        technique takes advantage of the sequence specificity of restriction endonucleases
        to construct an Illumina-compatible sequencing library containing DNA fragments
        that are between a pair of restriction sites located within close proximity.
        This results in a reduced sequencing library with coverage breadth that can
        be tuned by size selection. We assessed the performance of the metagenomic
        ddRADseq approach by applying the full method to human stool samples and generating

        ddRADseq does introduce some bias in taxonomic representation, the bias is

        aim of the study was to evaluate the performance of sudoscan in screening
        diabetic microvascular complications in patients with type 2 diabete mellitus
        (T2DM). 515 patients with T2DM aged from 23 to 89 years were included for
        analysis in our study. The mean age was 60.00 \u00b1 11.37 years and the mean
        duration of T2DM was 8.44 \u00b1 7.56 years. Electrochemical skin conductance
        (ESC) in hands and feet was evaluated by SUDOCAN. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy
        (DPN) was diagnosed in 378 patients (44.3%), diabetic kidney disease (DKD)
        in 161 patients (31.26%), diabetic retinopathy (DR) in 148 patients (28.74%).
        Hands and feet ESC was significantly and independently associated with the
        presence of DPN, DKD and DR. Patients with a lower ESC (&lt;60 \u00b5S) had
        5.63-fold increased likelihood of having DPN, 4.90-fold increased likelihood
        of having DKD, 1.01-fold increased likelihood of having DR, than those with
        a higher ESC. Age, duration of T2DM, smoking, renal function and vibration
        perception thresholds were negatively correlated with ESC. Sudoscan parameters
        were correlated with diabetic microvascular complications, especially with
        DPN. Sudoscan could be an effective screening tool in primary health care

        mechanisms underlying RNA splicing regulation in response to viral infection
        are poorly understood. Classical swine fever (CSF), one of the most economically
        important and highly contagious swine diseases worldwide, is caused by classical
        swine fever virus (CSFV). Here, we used high-throughput sequencing to obtain
        the digital gene expression (DGE) profile in swine umbilical vein endothelial
        cells (SUVEC) to identify different response genes for CSFV by using both
        Shimen and C strains. The numbers of clean tags obtained from the libraries
        of the control and both CSFV-infected libraries were 3,473,370, 3,498,355,
        and 3,327,493 respectively. In the comparison among the control, CSFV-C, and
        CSFV-Shimen groups, 644, 158, and 677 differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
        were confirmed in the three groups. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that
        many of these DEGs were enriched in spliceosome, ribosome, proteasome, ubiquitin-mediated
        proteolysis, cell cycle, focal adhesion, Wnt signalling pathway, etc., where
        the processes differ between CSFV strains of differing virulence. To further
        elucidate important mechanisms related to the differential infection by the
        CSFV Shimen and C strains, we identified four possible profiles to assess
        the significantly expressed genes only by CSFV Shimen or CSFV C strain. GO
        analysis showed that infection with CSFV Shimen and C strains disturbed \u2018RNA
        splicing\u2019 of SUVEC, resulting in differential \u2018gene expression\u2019
        in SUVEC. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was identified as a significant
        response regulator contributed to impact on SUVEC function for CSFV Shimen.
        This computational study suggests that CSFV of differing virulence could induce
        alterations in RNA splicing regulation in the host cell to change cell metabolism,
        resulting in acute haemorrhage and pathological damage or infectious tolerance.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.2113","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,8]],"date-time":"2016-06-08T06:26:39Z","timestamp":1465367199000},"page":"e2113","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["Different

        and Objective<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>Docker is a light containerization program
        that shows almost the same performance as a local environment. Recently, many
        bioinformatics tools have been distributed as Docker images that include complex
        settings such as libraries, configurations, and data if needed, as well as
        the actual tools. Users can simply download and run them without making the
        effort to compile and configure them, and can obtain reproducible results.
        In spite of these advantages, several problems remain. First, there is a lack
        of clear standards for distribution of Docker images, and the Docker Hub often
        provides multiple images with the same objective but different uses. For these
        reasons, it can be difficult for users to learn how to select and use them.
        Second, Docker images are often not suitable as a component of a pipeline,
        because many of them include big data. Moreover, a group of users can have
        difficulties when sharing a pipeline composed of Docker images. Users of a
        group may modify scripts or use different versions of the data, which causes
        inconsistent results.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Methods

        we developed a Java web application, DockerBIO, which provides reliable, verified,
        light-weight Docker images for various bioinformatics tools and for various
        kinds of reference data. With DockerBIO, users can easily build a pipeline
        with tools and data registered at DockerBIO, and if necessary, users can easily
        register new tools or data. Built pipelines are registered in DockerBIO, which
        provides an efficient running environment for the pipelines registered at
        DockerBIO. This enables user groups to run their pipelines without expending
        much effort to copy and modify them.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.5954","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,27]],"date-time":"2018-11-27T09:06:46Z","timestamp":1543309606000},"page":"e5954","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["DockerBIO:

        we found initial evidence of such proteinaceous mesostructures.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>EM
        preparations with high-pressure freezing and accelerated freeze substitution
        revealed an extraordinary intracellular source of mesostructured inclusions
        in both the cyto-and nucleoplasm of the epidermal lining of ovisacs of <jats:italic>A.
        franciscana<\/jats:italic>. Confocal reflection microscopy not only confirmed
        our finding; it also revealed reflective, light dispersing activity of these
        flake-like structures, their positioning and orientation with respect to the
        ovisac inside. Both the striation of alternating electron dense and electron-lucent
        components and the sharp edges of the flakes indicate self-assembly of material
        of yet unknown origin under supposed participation of crystallization. However,
        selected area electron diffraction could not verify the status of crystallization.
        Energy dispersive X-ray analysis measured a marked increase in nitrogen within
        the flake-like inclusion, and the almost complete absence of elements that
        are typically involved in inorganic crystallization. This rise in nitrogen
        could possibility be related to higher package density of proteins, achieved
        by mesostructure assembly.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title>Conclusions<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The
        ovisac lining of <jats:italic>A. franciscana<\/jats:italic> is endowed with
        numerous mesostructured inclusions that have not been previously reported.
        We hypothesize that their self-assembly was from proteinaceous polycrystalline
        units and carbohydrates. These mesostructured flakes displayed active optical
        properties, as an umbrella-like, reflective cover of the ovisac, which suggests
        a functional role in the reproduction of <jats:italic>A.\u00a0franciscana<\/jats:italic>.
        In turn, studies into ovisac mesostructured inclusions could help to optimizing
        rearing <jats:italic>Artemia<\/jats:italic> as feed for fish farming. We propose
        <jats:italic>Artemia<\/jats:italic> ovisacs as an <jats:italic>in vivo<\/jats:italic>
        model system for studying mesostructure formation.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.3923","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,27]],"date-time":"2017-10-27T08:49:29Z","timestamp":1509094169000},"page":"e3923","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["Novel

        malnutrition remains a severe problem in ruminant production and can increase
        susceptibility to infection, especially during the growth stage. This study
        aimed to explore substituting soybean meal with corn on activation of the
        TLR pathway and potential impact on immune response bias towards Type 1 or
        Type 2 using growing female goats as experimental animals.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>Twenty-four
        Xiangdong black goats (initial BW = 19.83 \u00b1 0.53 kg, about 8 \u00b1 0.3
        months old) were selected and randomly divided into the corn-soybean meal
        basal diet group (CON, 10.77% protein) and replacing soybean meal with 100%
        of corn group (CRS, 5.52% protein). EDTA whole blood and serum samples were
        collected prior to slaughter for determinations of blood cell counts, anti-inflammatory
        cytokines and antibodies. The duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon tissues were
        collected after formal trial to study the effect of CRS diet on the expression
        of TLR4 pathway.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>Our
        results showed CRS diet did not induce a significant change in immune function,
        as evidenced by the observations that white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil (Neu),
        lymphocyte (Lym), monocyte (Mon), eosinophil (Eos), interleukin-4 (IL-4),
        IL-5, IL-13, immunoglobin G (IgG), IgA, and IgM levels in serum were similar
        between the two groups. RT-PCR results showed the expression of tumor necrosis
        factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) (<jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic> &lt; 0.01) and interferon-\u03b2
        (IFN-\u03b2) (<jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic> &lt; 0.01) were up-regulated in
        the colon of goats in the CRS group. No differences in the expression of myeloid
        differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) adaptor-like protein (TIRAP), IL-1 receptor\u2013associated
        kinase 1 (IRAK1), TNF receptor related factor 6 (TRAF6), NF-kappa B (NF-\u03baB),
        mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) or activator protein-1 (AP-1) in
        the TLR4\/MyD88 dependent pathway were observed between the two groups for
        any of the tested tissue. However, the expression of NF-\u03baB activator
        (TANK) binding kinase 1 (TBK1) in TLR4\/MyD88 independent pathway was up-regulated
        in the duodenum and colon (<jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic> &lt; 0.01), and the
        expression of interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF3) was up-regulated (<jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic>
        &lt; 0.01) in colon.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Conclusions<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>Our
        results suggested that the CRS diet failed to induce a significant change
        in innate immunity and adaptive immunity in growing goats. However, the up-regulated
        TBK1 and IRF3 in the colon from the CRS goats suggests that the CRS diet may
        induce the expression of Th1-type proinflammatory cytokines and inflammatory
        response through a TLR4-MyD88-independent pathway, and the colon may be the
        easiest targeted section in the intestinal tract.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.12910","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,7]],"date-time":"2022-02-07T08:31:57Z","timestamp":1644222717000},"page":"e12910","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Effects

        proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) is a major cause of cardiovascular
        diseases (CVDs). Many studies suggest that vascular injury triggers VSMC dedifferentiation,
        which results in VSMC changes from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype;
        however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unclear.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title><jats:p>In
        this study, we examined how VSMC responds under mechanical stress by using
        time-course microarray data. A three-phase study was proposed to investigate
        the stress-induced differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in VSMC. First, DEGs
        were identified by using the moderated t-statistics test. Second, more DEGs
        were inferred by using the Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM). Finally, the topological
        parameters-based method and cluster analysis approach were employed to predict
        the last batch of DEGs. To identify the potential drugs for vascular diseases
        involve VSMC proliferation, the drug-gene interaction database, Connectivity
        Map (cMap) was employed. Success of the predictions were determined using
        in-vitro data, i.e. MTT and clonogenic assay.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results<\/jats:title><jats:p>Based
        on the differential expression calculation, at least 23 DEGs were found, and
        the findings were qualified by previous studies on VSMC. The results of gene
        set enrichment analysis indicated that the most often found enriched biological
        processes are cell-cycle-related processes. Furthermore, more stress-induced
        genes, well supported by literature, were found by applying graph theory to
        the gene association network (GAN). Finally, we showed that by processing
        the cMap input queries with a cluster algorithm, we achieved a substantial
        increase in the number of potential drugs with experimental IC50 measurements.
        With this novel approach, we have not only successfully identified the DEGs,
        but also improved the DEGs prediction by performing the topological and cluster
        analysis. Moreover, the findings are remarkably validated and in line with
        the literature. Furthermore, the cMap and DrugBank resources were used to
        identify potential drugs and targeted genes for vascular diseases involve
        VSMC proliferation. Our findings are supported by in-vitro experimental IC50,
        binding activity data and clinical trials.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusion<\/jats:title><jats:p>This

        was different regarding quantities over time. Interestingly, hydroxy proline
        was always up-regulated in higher quantities in response to pathogen infection
        in the genotype TAM-Uvalde. Also, the up-regulation in higher quantities of
        gamma-aminobutyric acid in the genotype TAM-Uvalde 48 and 72 hours after inoculation,
        suggests more penetration of the pathogen in its roots. Hence, taken together,

        degradation is a well-documented trend, but the spread of mangroves within
        the Siangshan Wetland in Hsinchu, Taiwan, runs contrary to that trend. The
        spread of mangroves changes the structure and functions of habitats for benthic
        organisms, causes infilling of estuaries and flooding and creates breeding
        grounds for small black mosquitoes. A large-scale mangrove-removal project
        was undertaken by the Hsinchu City Government from October 2015 to March 2016.
        They also investigated the consequences of mangrove removal on benthic organisms
        and adjacent habitats from October 2015 to September 2016, and the density,
        species count, Shannon\u2013Wiener index (<jats:italic>H<\/jats:italic>\u2032),
        and Pielou\u2019s evenness index (<jats:italic>J<\/jats:italic>\u2032) of
        the mangrove and non-mangrove regions were compared. In this study, we used
        satellite telemetry images to monitor fluctuations in mangrove density from
        2006 to 2016. The non-mangrove region exhibited more variations than the mangrove
        region. After mangrove removal, species returned to their original habitats
        and noteworthy biological values significantly increased in the mangrove regions.
        This study presents evidence to argue that mangrove removal benefits benthic
        organisms. The results indicate that mangrove removal can be an appropriate
        habitat rehabilitation strategy for benthic organisms. The ecological findings
        of this study can inform coastal managers or other officials who seek to steward
        mangrove biomass.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.5670","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,4]],"date-time":"2018-10-04T14:47:46Z","timestamp":1538664466000},"page":"e5670","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":8,"title":["Effects

        are one of the most commonly transformed aquatic ecosystems. Most papers present
        significantly negative effects of activities such as dredging or channel regulation
        on the ecological status of rivers. The purpose of this work was to compare
        the response of various groups of invertebrates (Mollusca, Hydrachnidia, Odonata,
        Heteroptera, Coleoptera and Trichoptera) to an intervention involving dredging
        in conjunction with the removal of riparian vegetation. Habitat diversity
        increased after the dredging, and more individuals and species were caught
        than before the dredging. The increase in habitat diversity after the dredging
        translated into an increase in the species diversity of most investigated
        groups. Individual groups of invertebrates showed varied responses to the
        dredging, depending on the role of the terrestrial phase in their life cycle:
        the greater the role of the terrestrial phase in the life cycle, the more
        the group was affected by changes in the terrestrial environment following
        the intervention. In consequence, the intervention had the greatest negative
        impact on insects, and among these, on adult Odonata. The following conclusions
        can be drawn: (1) Dredging can benefit a previously anthropogenically transformed
        river ecosystem by increasing habitat diversity; (2) Odonata are particularly
        useful for assessing the impact of this type of intervention on invertebrate
        communities. They can be considered good indicators of habitat disturbances
        in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.12224","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,29]],"date-time":"2021-09-29T09:01:22Z","timestamp":1632906082000},"page":"e12224","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Anthropogenic

        occurrence of pathological cardiac fibrosis is attributed to tissue hypoxia.
        Circular RNAs play significant regulatory roles in multiple cardiovascular
        diseases and are involved in the regulation of physiological and pathophysiological
        processes. CircHIPK3 has been identified as the one of the most crucial regulators
        in cardiac fibrosis. However, the mechanisms by which circHIPK3 regulates
        cardiac fibrosis under hypoxia remain unclear. Our study aimed to determine
        circHIPK3 expression in cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) and investigate the functions
        of circHIPK3 in hypoxia environment.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>The
        expression level of circHIPK3 in CFs under hypoxia (1% O<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>)
        was analyzed by qRT-PCR. The role of circHIPK3 on the proliferation and migration
        of CFs were determined by EdU, cell wound scratch assay and cell cycle. The
        expression of proteins associated with phenotypic transformation in CFs in
        vitro was examined by immunofluorescence assay and western blot. Bioinformatics
        analysis, dual luciferase activity assay and RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization
        assay revealed that miR-152-3p was identified as a target of circHIPK3 and
        that TGF-\u03b22 was targeted by miR-152-3p.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>CircHIPK3
        expression was significantly upregulated in CFs in a hypoxic environment.
        In vitro, overexpressing circHIPK3 obviously promoted CF proliferation, migration
        and phenotypic changes under hypoxia, but those processes were suppressed
        by circHIPK3 silencing. CircHIPK3 acted as an endogenous miR-152-3p sponge
        and miR-152-3p aggravated circHIPK3 silencing induced inhibition of CF proliferation,
        migration, phenotypic transformation and TGF-\u03b22 expression in vitro.
        In summary, circHIPK3 plays a pivotal role in the development of cardiac fibrosis
        by targeting the miR-152-3p\/TGF-\u03b22 axis.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Conclusions<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>These
        findings demonstrated that circHIPK3 acted as a miR-152-3p sponge to regulate
        CF proliferation, migration and phenotypic transformation through TGF-\u03b22,
        revealing that modulation of circHIPK3 expression may represent a potential
        target to promote the transition of hypoxia-induced CFs to myofibroblasts.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.9796","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,25]],"date-time":"2020-08-25T08:24:57Z","timestamp":1598343897000},"page":"e9796","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":12,"title":["CircHIPK3

        suggests that learning to perform magic tricks can promote both physical and
        psychological wellbeing. The current study extended this work by examining
        the impact of learning magic tricks on divergent thinking. A group of 10-
        to 11-year-old children completed Guilford\u2019s Alternate Uses Test both
        before and after participating in either a magic-based, or art-based, activity.
        As predicted, compared to the art-based activity, the magic-based activity
        resulted in a significantly greater increase in both AUT Fluency and AUT Originality
        scores. Rosenberg\u2019s Self-Esteem Scale and Dweck\u2019s Implicit Theories
        of Intelligence Scale for Children was also completed after each activity,
        and participants\u2019 self-esteem scores were higher after the art-based
        activity than the magic-based activity. In an exploratory aspect of the study,
        the AUT was re-administered to both groups three weeks later, and yielded
        no significant differences. The practical and theoretical implications of
        these findings are discussed, along with recommendations for future research.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.11289","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,15]],"date-time":"2021-04-15T09:00:36Z","timestamp":1618477236000},"page":"e11289","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["Conjuring

        diet that is high in sugar and fat is a precursor to various chronic diseases,
        especially hyperlipidemia. Patients with hyperlipidemia have increased levels
        of plasma free fatty acids and an ectopic accumulation of lipids. The kidney
        is one of the main organs affected by this disease and, recently, there have
        been more studies conducted on renal injury caused by hyperlipidemia. The
        main pathological mechanism is closely related to renal lipotoxicity. However,
        in different kidney cells, the reaction mechanism varies due to the different
        affinities of the lipid receptors. At present, it is believed that in addition
        to lipotoxicity, hyperlipidemia induced-renal injury is also closely related
        to oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and inflammatory reactions,
        which are the result of multiple factors. Exercise plays an important role
        in the prevention of various chronic diseases and recently emerging researches
        indicated its positive effects to renal injury caused by hyperlipidemia. However,
        there are few studies summarizing the effects of exercise on this disease
        and the specific mechanisms need to be further explored. This article summarizes
        the mechanisms of hyperlipidemia induced-renal injury at the cellular level
        and discusses the ways in which exercise may regulate it. The results provide
        theoretical support and novel approaches for identifying the intervention
        target to treat hyperlipidemia induced-renal injury.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.15435","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,1]],"date-time":"2023-06-01T07:52:14Z","timestamp":1685605934000},"page":"e15435","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The

        diagnosis and treatment can improve the survival rates of patients with laryngeal

        collected fasting plasma from LSCC patients and healthy volunteers, as well
        as cancer and para-carcinoma tissues from LSCC patients, and performed quantitative
        detection of amino acid levels using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.
        We used overall analysis and multivariate statistical analysis to screen out
        the statistically significant differential amino acids in the plasma and tissue
        samples, conducted receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of the
        differential amino acids to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the
        differential amino acids, and finally determined the diagnostic value of amino
        acids for laryngeal cancer. Additionally, we identified amino acids in the
        plasma and tissue samples that are valuable for the early diagnosis of laryngeal

        showed that they may be new biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of
        LSCC. According to the TNM staging system, phenylalanine (Phe) and isoleucine
        (Ile) were screened out in the plasma of LSCC patients at early (I and II)
        and advanced (III and IV) stages; ornithine hydrochloride (Orn), glutamic
        acid (Glu), and Glycine (Gly) were selected in the tissue. These dysregulated

        are one of the important indicators used in assessing the anthropic impact
        on aquatic ecosystems. The structure of macrophyte communities of two rivers
        were compared by species composition, dominant species and projective cover
        using statistical methods. It is shown that the influence of storm runoff
        on these rivers is manifested in the form of a change in the dominant species
        composition. Based on the statistical analysis carried out, it can be argued
        that, despite the peculiarities of the flora composition of each of the rivers,
        the influence of storm runoffs largely neutralizes this specificity, determining
        the situation in local areas immediately below the runoff. In the area of
        the effluent discharge the dominance of individual species and an increase
        in the area overgrown with macrophytes was observed. In the area of stormwater
        discharge on the Psel River, species were usually present: <jats:italic>Nuphar

        research exists on the life history traits, evolutionary history, and environmental
        factors that shape the population genetic structure of marine organisms, including
        sharks and rays. Conservation concerns are particularly strong for this group
        as they are highly susceptible to anthropogenic stressors due to a combination
        of life history traits including late maturity and low fecundity. Here, we
        provide a review and synthesis of the global phylogeography of sharks and
        rays. We examined existing data for 40 species of sharks belonging to 17 genera
        and 19 species of rays belonging to 11 genera. Median joining haplotype networks
        were constructed for each species for the mtDNA cytochrome C oxidase subunit
        I (COI), and an Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) was conducted to understand
        patterns of genetic diversity and structure across the three major ocean basins\u2014the
        Indian, Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Haplotype networks showed very shallow
        coalescence in most species, a finding previously reported for marine teleosts.
        Star topologies were predominant among sharks while complex mutational topologies
        predominated among rays, a finding we attribute to extremely limited dispersal
        in the early life history of rays. Population structuring varied amongst species
        groups, apparently due to differences in life history traits including reproductive
        philopatry, site fidelity, pelagic habitat, migratory habits, and dispersal
        ability. In comparison to reef-associated and demersal species, pelagic and
        semi pelagic species showed lower levels of structure between and within ocean
        basins. As expected, there is variation between taxa and groups, but there
        are also some broad patterns that can guide management and conservation strategies.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.15396","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,1]],"date-time":"2023-06-01T08:00:22Z","timestamp":1685606422000},"page":"e15396","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Phylogeography

        fractures are a major public health problem with increasing relevance in aging
        societies. They are associated with high mortality rates, morbidity, and loss
        of independence. The aim of the EMAAge study was to determine the impact of
        hip fractures on patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL),
        and to identify potential risk factors for worse outcomes.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>EMAAge
        is a multicenter, prospective cohort study of patients who suffered a hip
        fracture. Patients or, if necessary, proxies were interviewed after initial
        treatment and after six months using standardized questionnaires including
        the EQ-5D-5L instrument, the Oxford Hip Score, the PHQ-4, the Short Nutritional
        Assessment Questionnaire, and items on patients living situation. Medical
        data on diagnoses, comorbidities, medications, and hospital care were derived
        from hospital information systems.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>A
        total of 326 patients were included. EQ-5D index values decreased from a mean
        of 0.70 at baseline to 0.63 at six months. The mean self-rated health on the
        EQ-VAS decreased from 69.9 to 59.4. Multivariable linear regression models
        revealed three relevant associated factors with the six-months EQ-5D index:
        symptoms of depression and anxiety, pre-fracture limitations in activities
        of daily living, and no referral to a rehabilitation facility had a negative
        impact. In addition, the six-months EQ-VAS was negatively associated with
        polypharmacy, living in a facility, and migration background.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title>Conclusions<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Hip
        fractures have a substantial negative impact on patients HRQOL. Our results
        suggest that there are modifying factors that need further investigation including
        polypharmacy and migration background. Structured and timely rehabilitation

        log-normal distribution is often used to analyze environmental data like daily
        rainfall amounts. The rainfall is of interest in Thailand because high variable
        climates can lead to periodic water stress and scarcity. The mean, standard
        deviation or coefficient of variation of the rainfall in the area is usually
        estimated. The climate moisture index is the ratio of plant water demand to
        precipitation. The climate moisture index should use the coefficient of variation
        instead of the standard deviation for comparison between areas with widely
        different means. The larger coefficient of variation indicates greater dispersion,
        whereas the lower coefficient of variation indicates the lower risk. The common
        coefficient of variation, is the weighted coefficients of variation based
        on <jats:italic>k<\/jats:italic> areas, presents the average daily rainfall.
        Therefore, the common coefficient of variation is used to describe overall
        water problems of <jats:italic>k<\/jats:italic> areas. In this paper, we propose
        four novel approaches for the confidence interval estimation of the common
        coefficient of variation of log-normal distributions based on the fiducial
        generalized confidence interval (FGCI), method of variance estimates recovery
        (MOVER), computational, and Bayesian approaches. A Monte Carlo simulation
        was used to evaluate the coverage probabilities and average lengths of the
        confidence intervals. In terms of coverage probability, the results show that
        the FGCI approach provided the best confidence interval estimates for most
        cases except for when the sample case was equal to six populations (<jats:italic>k<\/jats:italic>\u00a0=\u00a06)
        and the sample sizes were small (<jats:italic>n<\/jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>I<\/jats:italic><\/jats:sub>\u00a0&lt;\u00a050),
        for which the MOVER confidence interval estimates were the best. The efficacies
        of the proposed approaches are illustrated with example using real-life daily
        rainfall datasets from regions of Thailand.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.10004","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,21]],"date-time":"2020-09-21T07:59:58Z","timestamp":1600675198000},"page":"e10004","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":9,"title":["Confidence
