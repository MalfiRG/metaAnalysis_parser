        strategies of clonal organs, and parent and offspring shoots of <jats:italic>Phragmites
        australis<\/jats:italic> (common reed) to heavy metal pollution in soils are
        not well known. To clarify the tolerance or resistance strategies in reeds,
        we conducted a pot experiment with five levels of Pb concentration (0\u223c4,500
        mg kg<jats:sup>\u22121<\/jats:sup>) in flood and drought conditions. Lead
        toxicity had no inhibitory effect on the number of offspring shoots in flood
        environment; however, biomass accumulation, and photosynthetic and clonal
        growth parameters were inhibited in both water environment. At each treatment
        of Pb concentration, offspring shoots had greater biomass and higher photosynthesis
        indicators than parent shoots. The lowest Pb allocation was found in rhizomes.
        More of the Pb transported to above-ground parts tended to accumulate in parent
        shoots rather than in offspring shoots. Biomass and photosynthesis of offspring
        shoots, rhizome length, and the number of buds, rhizomes and offspring shoots
        in the flooded treatment were significantly greater than those in the drought
        treatment. Our results indicated that the tolerance strategies used by reeds,
        including higher biomass accumulation and photosynthesis in offspring shoots,
        low allocation of Pb in rhizomes and offspring shoots, and stable clonal growth,
        maintained the stability of population propagation and productivity, improving
        the resistance of reeds to Pb pollution in flood environment. However, the
        resistance or tolerance was significantly reduced by the synergistic effect
        of Pb and drought, which significantly inhibited biomass accumulation, photosynthesis,
        and clonal growth of reeds.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.4188","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,3]],"date-time":"2018-01-03T09:21:28Z","timestamp":1514971288000},"page":"e4188","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Resistance

        is one of the most frequently occurring stressors confronted by industrial
        cultures of sea cucumber and can cause large economic losses and resource
        degradation. However, its responsive mechanisms are still lacking. In this
        paper, the physiological responses of <jats:italic>Apostichopus japonicus<\/jats:italic>
        to oxygen deficiency was illustrated, including induced oxidative response
        and immune defense and changed digestive enzymes activities. Significantly
        increased activities of alpha-amylase (AMS), acid phosphatase (ACP), lactate
        dehydrogenase, catalase, peroxidase, succinate dehydrogenase and higher content
        of malondialdehyde, and decreased activities of lipase and trypsin (TRY) were
        observed after hypoxia exposure (dissolved oxygen [DO] 2 mg\/L). Expressions
        of key genes showed that <jats:italic>AMS, peptidase, ACP, alkaline phosphatase,
        lysozyme, heat shock protein 70<\/jats:italic> and <jats:italic>glutathione
        peroxidase<\/jats:italic> were increased and <jats:italic>TRY<\/jats:italic>
        was decreased under hypoxia. With the decline of the DO level, the decreased
        tendency of oxygen consumption rates was different in varied weight groups.
        Moreover, respiratory trees were observed degraded under long-term hypoxia
        stress, thus leading a negative effect of respiration. These results could

        of Andean groups with southern origins, although it has been suggested that
        northern and southern groups have contributed roughly equally to the high
        Andean (i.e., p\u00e1ramo) flora. Here we infer the evolutionary history of
        the southern hemisphere plant genus <jats:italic>Gunnera<\/jats:italic>, a
        lineage with a rich fossil history and an important ecological role as an
        early colonising species characteristic of wet, montane environments. Our
        results show striking contrasts in species diversification, where some species
        may have persisted for some 90 million years, and whereas others date to less
        than 2 Ma since origination. The outstanding longevity of the group is likely
        linked to a high degree of niche conservatism across its highly disjunct range,
        whereby <jats:italic>Gunnera<\/jats:italic> tracks damp and boggy soils in
        cool habitats. Colonisation of the northern Andes is related to Quaternary
        climate change, with subsequent rapid diversification appearing to be driven

        Element Analysis (FEA) is a useful method for understanding form and function.
        However, modelling of fossil taxa invariably involves assumptions as a result
        of preservation-induced loss of information in the fossil record. To test
        the validity of predictions from FEA, given such assumptions, these results
        could be compared to independent lines of evidence for cranial mechanics.
        In the present study a new concept of using bone microstructure to predict
        stress distribution in the skull during feeding is put forward and a correlation
        between bone microstructure and results of computational biomechanics (FEA)
        is carried out. The bony framework is a product of biological optimisation;
        bone structure is created to meet local mechanical conditions. To test how
        well results from FEA correlate to cranial mechanics predicted from bone structure,
        the well-known temnospondyl <jats:italic>Metoposaurus krasiejowensis<\/jats:italic>
        was used as a model. A crucial issue to Temnospondyli is their feeding mode:
        did they suction feed or employ direct biting, or both? Metoposaurids have
        previously been characterised either as active hunters or passive bottom dwellers.
        In order to test the correlation between results from FEA and bone microstructure,
        two skulls of <jats:italic>Metoposaurus<\/jats:italic> were used<jats:italic>,<\/jats:italic>
        one modelled under FE analyses, while for the second one 17 dermal bone microstructure
        were analysed. Thus, for the first time, results predicting cranial mechanical
        behaviour using both methods are merged to understand the feeding strategy
        of <jats:italic>Metoposaurus<\/jats:italic>. <jats:italic>Metoposaurus<\/jats:italic>
        appears to have been an aquatic animal that exhibited a generalist feeding
        behaviour. This taxon may have used two foraging techniques in hunting; mainly
        bilateral biting and, to a lesser extent, lateral strikes. However, bone microstructure
        suggests that lateral biting was more frequent than suggested by Finite Element
        Analysis (FEA). One of the potential factors that determined its mode of life
        may have been water levels. During optimum water conditions, metoposaurids
        may have been more active ambush predators that were capable of lateral strikes
        of the head. The dry season required a less active mode of life when bilateral
        biting is particularly efficient. This, combined with their characteristically
        anteriorly positioned orbits, was optimal for ambush strategy. This ability
        to use alternative modes of food acquisition, independent of environmental
        conditions, might hold the key in explaining the very common occurrence of
        metoposaurids during the Late Triassic.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.4426","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,26]],"date-time":"2018-02-26T08:38:50Z","timestamp":1519634330000},"page":"e4426","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Merging

        surveys conducted on Reunion Island coral reefs revealed an atypical manifestation
        of black band disease on the main framework building coral, Porites lutea.
        This BBD manifestation (PorBBD) presented a thick lighter-colored band, which
        preceded the typical BBD lesion. Whilst BBD aetiology has been intensively
        described worldwide, it remains unclear if corals with apparently similar
        lesions across coral reefs are affected by the same pathogens. Therefore,
        a multidisciplinary approach involving field surveys, gross lesion monitoring,
        histopathology and 454-pyrosequencing was employed to provide the first comprehensive
        characterization of this particular manifestation. Surveys conducted within
        two geomorphological zones over two consecutive summers and winters showed
        spatial and seasonal patterns consistent with those found for typical BBD.
        Genetic analyses suggested an uncharacteristically high level of Vibrio spp.
        bacterial infection within PorBBD. However, microscopic analysis revealed
        high densities of cyanobacteria, penetrating the compromised tissue as well
        as the presence of basophilic bodies resembling bacterial aggregates in the
        living tissue, adjacent to the bacterial mat. Additionally, classical BBD-associated
        cyanobacterial strains, genetically related to Pseudoscillatoria coralii and
        Roseofilum reptotaenium were identified and isolated and the presence of sulfate-reducers
        or sulfide-oxidizers such as Desulfovibrio and Arcobacter, previously shown
        to be associated with anoxic microenvironment within typical BBD was also
        observed, confirming that PorBBD is a manifestation of classical BBD.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.2073","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,7,6]],"date-time":"2016-07-06T07:53:42Z","timestamp":1467791622000},"page":"e2073","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["Characterisation

        sour (bunch) rot is a polymicrobial disease of vineyards that causes millions
        of dollars in lost revenue per year due to decreased quality of grapes and
        resultant wine. The disease is associated with damaged berries infected with
        a community of acetic acid bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi that results
        in rotting berries with high amounts of undesirable volatile acidity. Many
        insect species cause the initial grape berry damage that can lead to this
        disease, but most studies have focused on the role of fruit flies in facilitating
        symptoms and vectoring the microorganisms of this disease complex. Like fruit
        flies, social wasps are abundant in vineyards where they feed on ripe berries
        and cause significant damage, while also dispersing yeasts involved in wine
        fermentation. Despite this, their possible role in disease facilitation and
        dispersal of grape rots has not been explored. We tested the hypothesis that
        the paper wasp <jats:italic>Polistes dominulus<\/jats:italic> could facilitate
        grape sour rot in the absence of other insect vectors. Using marker gene sequencing
        we characterized the bacterial and fungal community of wild-caught adults.
        We used a sterilized foraging arena to determine if these wasps transfer viable
        microorganisms when foraging. We then tested if wasps harboring their native
        microbial community, or those inoculated with sour rot, had an effect on grape
        sour rot incidence and severity using a laboratory foraging arena. We found
        that all wasps harbor some portion of the sour rot microbial community and
        that they have the ability to transfer viable microorganisms when foraging.
        Foraging by inoculated and uninoculated wasps led to an increase in berry
        rot disease symptom severity and incidence. Our results indicate that paper
        wasps can facilitate sour rot diseases in the absence of other vectors and
        that the mechanism of this facilitation may include both increasing host susceptibility
        and transmitting these microbial communities to the grapes. Social wasps are
        understudied but relevant players in the sour rot ecology of vineyards.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.3223","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,4,26]],"date-time":"2017-04-26T08:07:37Z","timestamp":1493194057000},"page":"e3223","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["The

        use of linear mixed effects models (LMMs) is increasingly common in the analysis
        of biological data. Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad
        range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex
        model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not
        always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference
        requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here,
        we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs
        to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered
        in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods
        of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory
        and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct
        the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those
        seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible
        code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and
        model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn
        from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.4794","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,23]],"date-time":"2018-05-23T08:55:29Z","timestamp":1527065729000},"page":"e4794","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["A

        this study, we investigated the impacts of in-situ nature and urban exposure
        on human brain activities and their dynamics. We randomly assigned 32 healthy
        right-handed college students (mean age = 20.6 years, SD = 1.6; 16 males)
        to a 20 min in-situ sitting exposure in either a nature (n = 16) or urban
        environment (n = 16) and measured their Electroencephalography (EEG) signals.
        Analyses revealed that a brief in-situ restorative nature experience may induce
        more efficient and stronger brain connectivity with enhanced small-world properties
        compared with a stressful urban experience. The enhanced small-world properties
        were found to be correlated with \u201ccoherent\u201d experience measured
        by Perceived Restorativeness Scale (PRS). Exposure to nature also induces
        stronger long-term correlated activity across different brain regions with
        a right lateralization. These findings may advance our understanding of the
        functional activities during in-situ environmental exposures and imply that
        a nature or nature-like environment may potentially benefit cognitive processes
        and mental well-being.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.2210","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,7,19]],"date-time":"2016-07-19T08:26:03Z","timestamp":1468916763000},"page":"e2210","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["Enhanced

        be an obstacle for the use of the seeds of this plant by humans. However,
        it is still unknown if the lemmas have other ecological roles such as resisting

        The results showed that lemmas significantly improved the amount of water
        uptake and slowed down the dehydration rate of the seeds under dry conditions.
        Likewise, the lemmas induced seed dormancy, and removal of the lemmas improved
        the germination at all temperatures. Although germination percentage of the
        seeds without lemmas were higher than that of seeds with lemmas under salinity
        stress, the recovery and total percentage were significantly lower than the
        seeds with lemmas, especially at 400 mM stress. These results suggest that
        the lemmas play a vital function in water uptake, dehydration and salt tolerance
        during the germination stage of the seeds as a response to adverse environmental
        conditions. Although lemmas showed a dormancy effect, if we want to plant

        availability and diet selection are important factors influencing the abundance
        and distribution of wild waterbirds. In order to better understand changes
        in waterbird population, it is essential to figure out what they feed on.
        However, analyzing their diet could be difficult and inefficient using traditional
        methods such as microhistologic observation. Here, we addressed this gap of
        knowledge by investigating the diet of greater white-fronted goose<jats:italic>Anser
        albifrons<\/jats:italic>and bean goose<jats:italic>Anser fabalis<\/jats:italic>,
        which are obligate herbivores wintering in China, mostly in the Middle and
        Lower Yangtze River floodplain. First, we selected a suitable and high-resolution
        marker gene for wetland plants that these geese would consume during the wintering
        period. Eight candidate genes were included:<jats:italic>rbc<\/jats:italic>L,<jats:italic>rpo<\/jats:italic>C1,<jats:italic>rpo<\/jats:italic>B,<jats:italic>mat<\/jats:italic>K,<jats:italic>trn<\/jats:italic>H-<jats:italic>psb<\/jats:italic>A,<jats:italic>trn<\/jats:italic>L
        (UAA),<jats:italic>atp<\/jats:italic>F<jats:italic>-atp<\/jats:italic>H, and<jats:italic>psb<\/jats:italic>K<jats:italic>-psb<\/jats:italic>I.
        The selection was performed via analysis of representative sequences from
        NCBI and comparison of amplification efficiency and resolution power of plant
        samples collected from the wintering area. The<jats:italic>trn<\/jats:italic>L
        gene was chosen at last with c\/h primers, and a local plant reference library
        was constructed with this gene. Then, utilizing DNA metabarcoding, we discovered
        15 food items in total from the feces of these birds. Of the 15 unique dietary
        sequences, 10 could be identified at specie level. As for greater white-fronted
        goose, 73% of sequences belonged to<jats:italic>Poaceae<\/jats:italic>spp.,
        and 26% belonged to<jats:italic>Carex<\/jats:italic>spp. In contrast, almost
        all sequences of bean goose belonged to<jats:italic>Carex<\/jats:italic>spp.
        (99%). Using the same samples, microhistology provided consistent food composition
        with metabarcoding results for greater white-fronted goose, while 13% of<jats:italic>Poaceae<\/jats:italic>was
        recovered for bean goose. In addition, two other taxa were discovered only
        through microhistologic analysis. Although most of the identified taxa matched
        relatively well between the two methods, DNA metabarcoding gave taxonomically
        more detailed information. Discrepancies were likely due to biased PCR amplification
        in metabarcoding, low discriminating power of current marker genes for monocots,
        and biases in microhistologic analysis. The diet differences between two geese
        species might indicate deeper ecological significance beyond the scope of
        this study. We concluded that DNA metabarcoding provides new perspectives
        for studies of herbivorous waterbird diets and inter-specific interactions,
        as well as new possibilities to investigate interactions between herbivores
        and plants. In addition, microhistologic analysis should be used together
        with metabarcoding methods to integrate this information.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.2345","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,8,17]],"date-time":"2016-08-17T07:56:28Z","timestamp":1471420588000},"page":"e2345","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Selection

        whale shark <jats:italic>Rhincodon typus<\/jats:italic> is an endangered,
        highly migratory species with a wide, albeit patchy, distribution through
        tropical oceans. Ten aerial survey flights along the southern Mozambican coast,
        conducted between 2004\u20132008, documented a relatively high density of
        whale sharks along a 200 km stretch of the Inhambane Province, with a pronounced
        hotspot adjacent to Praia do Tofo. To examine the residency and movement of
        whale sharks in coastal areas around Praia do Tofo, where they may be more
        susceptible to gill net entanglement, we tagged 15 juveniles with SPOT5 satellite
        tags and tracked them for 2\u201388 days (mean = 27 days) as they dispersed
        from this area. Sharks travelled between 10 and 2,737 km (mean = 738 km) at
        a mean horizontal speed of 28 \u00b1\u00a017.1 SD km day<jats:sup>\u22121<\/jats:sup>.
        While several individuals left shelf waters and travelled across international
        boundaries, most sharks stayed in Mozambican coastal waters over the tracking
        period. We tested for whale shark habitat preferences, using sea surface temperature,
        chlorophyll-<jats:italic>a<\/jats:italic> concentration and water depth as
        variables, by computing 100 random model tracks for each real shark based
        on their empirical movement characteristics. Whale sharks spent significantly
        more time in cooler, shallower water with higher chlorophyll-<jats:italic>a<\/jats:italic>
        concentrations than model sharks, suggesting that feeding in productive coastal
        waters is an important driver of their movements. To investigate what this
        coastal habitat choice means for their conservation in Mozambique, we mapped
        gill nets during two dedicated aerial surveys along the Inhambane coast and
        counted gill nets in 1,323 boat-based surveys near Praia do Tofo. Our results
        show that, while whale sharks are capable of long-distance oceanic movements,
        they can spend a disproportionate amount of time in specific areas, such as
        along the southern Mozambique coast. The increasing use of drifting gill nets
        in this coastal hotspot for whale sharks is likely to be a threat to regional
        populations of this iconic species.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.4161","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,2]],"date-time":"2018-01-02T09:05:35Z","timestamp":1514883935000},"page":"e4161","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Satellite

        of species into communities following human disturbance (e.g., deforestation,
        fragmentation) may be governed by spatial (e.g., dispersal) or environmental
        (e.g., niche partitioning) mechanisms. Variation partitioning has been used
        to broadly disentangle spatial and environmental mechanisms, and approaches
        utilizing functional and phylogenetic characteristics of communities have
        been implemented to determine the relative importance of particular environmental
        (or niche-based) mechanisms. Nonetheless, few studies have integrated these
        quantitative approaches to comprehensively assess the relative importance
        of particular structuring processes.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title><jats:p>We
        employed a novel variation partitioning approach to evaluate the relative
        importance of particular spatial and environmental drivers of taxonomic, functional,
        and phylogenetic aspects of bat communities in a human-modified landscape
        in Costa Rica. Specifically, we estimated the amount of variation in species
        composition (taxonomic structure) and in two aspects of functional and phylogenetic
        structure (i.e., composition and dispersion) along a forest loss and fragmentation
        gradient that are uniquely explained by landscape characteristics (i.e., environment)
        or space to assess the importance of competing mechanisms.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results<\/jats:title><jats:p>The
        unique effects of space on taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic structure
        were consistently small. In contrast, landscape characteristics (i.e., environment)
        played an appreciable role in structuring bat communities. Spatially-structured
        landscape characteristics explained 84% of the variation in functional or
        phylogenetic dispersion, and the unique effects of landscape characteristics
        significantly explained 14% of the variation in species composition. Furthermore,
        variation in bat community structure was primarily due to differences in dispersion
        of species within functional or phylogenetic space along the gradient, rather
        than due to differences in functional or phylogenetic composition.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Discussion<\/jats:title><jats:p>Variation
        among bat communities was related to environmental mechanisms, especially
        niche-based (i.e., environmental) processes, rather than spatial mechanisms.
        High variation in functional or phylogenetic dispersion, as opposed to functional
        or phylogenetic composition, suggests that loss or gain of niche space is
        driving the progressive loss or gain of species with particular traits from
        communities along the human-modified gradient. Thus, environmental characteristics
        associated with landscape structure influence functional or phylogenetic aspects
        of bat communities by effectively altering the ways in which species partition

        nigra<\/jats:italic> (Ascidiacea, Ascidiidae) from a shallow fringing reef
        at Zeytouna Beach (Egyptian Red Sea), one of the collected ascidians showed
        peculiar perforations on its tunic. Once dissected, the perforations revealed
        to be the openings of a network of galleries excavated in the inner tunic
        (atrium) by at least six individuals of a polychaetous annelid. The worms
        belonged to the Autolytinae (Syllidae), a subfamily that is well known to
        include specialized predators and\/or symbionts, mostly associated with cnidarians.
        The Red Sea worms are here described as <jats:italic>Proceraea exoryxae<\/jats:italic>
        sp. nov., which are anatomically distinguished by the combination of simple
        chaetae only in anterior chaetigers, and a unique trepan with 33 teeth in
        one outer ring where one large tooth alternates with one medium-sized tricuspid
        tooth, and one inner ring with small teeth located just behind the large teeth.
        Male and female epitokes were found together with atokous individuals within
        galleries. <jats:italic>Proceraea exoryxae<\/jats:italic> sp. nov. constitutes
        the first known miner in the Autolytinae and the second species in this taxon

        Galapagos Sailfin grouper,<jats:italic>Mycteroperca olfax<\/jats:italic>,
        locally known as bacalao and listed as vulnerable by the IUCN, is culturally,
        economically, and ecologically important to the Galapagos archipelago and
        its people. It is regionally endemic to the Eastern Tropical Pacific, and,
        while an important fishery resource that has shown substantial declines in
        recent years, to date no effective management regulations are in place to
        ensure the sustainability of the Galapagos fishery for this species. Previous
        estimates of longevity and size at maturity for bacalao are inconsistent with
        estimates for congeners, which brings into question the accuracy of prior
        estimates. We set out to assess the age, growth, and reproductive biology
        of bacalao in order to provide more accurate life history information to inform
        more effective fisheries management for this species. The oldest fish in our
        sample was 21 years old, which is 2\u20133 times greater than previously reported
        estimates of longevity. Parameter estimates for the von Bertalanffy growth
        function (<jats:italic>k<\/jats:italic>= 0.11,<jats:italic>L<\/jats:italic><jats:sub>\u221e<\/jats:sub>=
        110 cm TL, and<jats:italic>t<jats:sub>o<\/jats:sub><\/jats:italic>= \u2212
        1.7 years) show bacalao to grow much slower and attain substantially larger
        asymptotic maximum length than previous studies. Mean size at maturity (as
        female) was estimated at 65.3 cm TL, corresponding to a mean age of 6.5 years.
        We found that sex ratios were extremely female biased (0.009 M:1F), with a
        large majority of the individuals in our experimental catch being immature
        (79%). Our results show that bacalao grow slower, live longer, and mature

        effects of ice ages on speciation have been well documented for many European
        and North American taxa. In contrast, very few studies have addressed the
        consequences of such environmental and topographical changes in North East
        Asian species. More precisely, the Korean Peninsula offers a unique model
        to assess patterns and processes of speciation as it hosts the northern- and
        eastern-most distribution limit of some widespread Asian taxa. Despite this,
        studies addressing phylogeographic patterns and population genetics in the
        peninsula and surrounding countries are few and studies for most families
        are lacking. Here we inferred the phylogenetic relationships of the common
        toad (<jats:italic>Bufo gargarizans<\/jats:italic>) from South Korea and their
        North East Asian counterpart populations, based on mitochondrial data. Korean
        <jats:italic>B. gargarizans<\/jats:italic> GenBank BLASTs matched few individuals
        from nearby China, but the presence of a Korean clade suggests isolation on
        the Korean Peninsula, previous to the last glacial maximum, linked to sea
        level resurgence. Molecular clock calibrations within this group were used
        to date the divergence between clades and their relationship to paleo-climatic
        events in the area. Lack of genetic structure among South Korean populations
        and strong homogeneity between the Korean and some Chinese localities suggest
        weak isolation and recent expansion. Geographical projection of continuous
        coalescent maximum-clade-credibility trees shows an original Chinese expansion
        towards the Korean Peninsula through the Yellow Sea circa two million years
        ago with colonisation events dating circa 800 thousand years ago (K. y. a.).
        Following this colonisation, the data point to outgoing Korean Peninsula dispersal
        events throughout different periods, towards the North through land, and West
        through land bridge formations over the Yellow Sea during sea level falls.
        In accordance, demographic analyses revealed a population expansion in the
        Koran Peninsula circa 300 K. y. a., likely attributed to glacial cycle fluctuations.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.4044","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,11,28]],"date-time":"2017-11-28T08:54:50Z","timestamp":1511859290000},"page":"e4044","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Phylogeographic

        on connectivity is becoming increasingly in demand as marine protected areas
        are being designed as an integral part of a network to protect marine resources
        at the ecosystem level. Larval dispersal and population structure, however,
        remain very difficult to assess. Here, we tested the predictions of a detailed
        oceanographic connectivity model of larval dispersal and coral recruitment
        within Palau and between Palau and Yap, which was developed to support the
        review of the existing network of marine protected areas in Palau. We used
        high throughput microsatellite genotyping of the coral<jats:italic>Acropora
        hyacinthus<\/jats:italic>to characterize population genetic structure. Pairwise<jats:italic>F<\/jats:italic>\u2032<jats:sub><jats:italic>ST<\/jats:italic><\/jats:sub>values
        between Palau and Yap (0.10), Palau and Ngulu (0.09) and Yap and Ngulu (0.09)

        of sites within Palau (0.02\u20130.12) and within Yap (0.02\u20130.09) highlighting
        structure at island scale and indicating that recruitment may be even more
        localized than previously anticipated. A bottleneck test did not reveal any
        signs of a founder effect between Yap and Palau. Overall, the data supports
        the idea that recovery of<jats:italic>A. hyacinthus<\/jats:italic>in Palau
        did not come exclusively from a single source but most likely came from a
        combination of areas, including sites within Palau. In light of these results
        there seems to be very little connectivity around the barrier reef and management
        recommendation would be to increase the number or the size of MPAs within
        Palau.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.2330","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,8,18]],"date-time":"2016-08-18T07:52:01Z","timestamp":1471506721000},"page":"e2330","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["Population

        predicting species occurrence and behavior. Numerous hypotheses about the
        complex interactions among environmental factors have been proposed; however,
        these still remain controversial. This study aimed to identify the altitudinal
        patterns in breeding bird species richness or density and to test the hypotheses
        that climate, habitat heterogeneity (horizontal and vertical), and heterospecific
        attraction in a temperate forest, South Korea. We conducted a field survey
        of 142 plots at altitudes between 200 and 1,400 m a.s.l in the breeding season.
        A total of 2,771 individuals from 53 breeding bird species were recorded.
        Altitudinal patterns of species richness and density showed a hump-shaped
        pattern, indicating that the highest richness and density could be observed
        at moderate altitudes. Models constructed with 13 combinations of six variables
        demonstrated that species richness was positively correlated with vertical
        and horizontal habitat heterogeneity. Density was positively correlated with
        vertical, but not horizontal habitat heterogeneity, and negatively correlated
        with migratory bird ratio. No significant relationships were found between
        spring temperature and species richness or density. Therefore, the observed
        patterns in species richness support the hypothesis that habitat heterogeneity,
        rather than climate, is the main driver of species richness. Also, neither
        habitat heterogeneity nor climate hypotheses fully explains the observed patterns
        in density. However, vertical habitat heterogeneity does likely help explain
        observed patterns in density. The heterospecific attraction hypothesis did
        not apply to the distribution of birds along the altitudinal gradient. Appropriate
        management of vertical habitat heterogeneity, such as vegetation cover, should
        be maintained for the conservation of bird diversity in this area.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.4857","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,23]],"date-time":"2018-05-23T09:02:06Z","timestamp":1527066126000},"page":"e4857","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Altitudinal

        of fine-scale movement, performance, and energetics of hunting by large carnivores
        is critical for understanding the physiological underpinnings of trophic interactions.
        This is particularly challenging for wide-ranging terrestrial canid and felid
        predators, which can each affect ecosystem structure through distinct hunting
        modes. To compare free-ranging pursuit and escape performance from group-hunting
        and solitary predators in unprecedented detail, we calibrated and deployed
        accelerometer-GPS collars during predator-prey chase sequences using packs
        of hound dogs (<jats:italic>Canis lupus familiaris<\/jats:italic>, 26 kg,
        <jats:italic>n<\/jats:italic>\u00a0=\u00a04\u20135 per chase) pursuing simultaneously
        instrumented solitary pumas (<jats:italic>Puma concolor<\/jats:italic>, 60
        kg, <jats:italic>n<\/jats:italic>\u00a0=\u00a02). We then reconstructed chase
        paths, speed and turning angle profiles, and energy demands for hounds and
        pumas to examine performance and physiological constraints associated with
        cursorial and cryptic hunting modes, respectively. Interaction dynamics revealed
        how pumas successfully utilized terrain (e.g., fleeing up steep, wooded hillsides)
        as well as evasive maneuvers (e.g., jumping into trees, running in figure-8
        patterns) to increase their escape distance from the overall faster hounds
        (avg. 2.3\u00d7\u00a0faster). These adaptive strategies were essential to
        evasion in light of the mean 1.6\u00d7\u00a0higher mass-specific energetic
        costs of the chase for pumas compared to hounds (mean: 0.76 <jats:italic>vs.<\/jats:italic>
        1.29 kJ\u00a0kg<jats:sup>\u22121<\/jats:sup>\u00a0min<jats:sup>\u22121<\/jats:sup>,
        respectively). On an instantaneous basis, escapes were more costly for pumas,
        requiring exercise at \u226590% of predicted $\\dot {\\mathrm{V }}{\\mathrm{O}}_{2\\mathrm{MAX}}$
        and consuming as much energy per minute as approximately 5\u00a0min of active
        hunting. Our results demonstrate the marked investment of energy for evasion
        by a large, solitary carnivore and the advantage of dynamic maneuvers to postpone
        being overtaken by group-hunting canids.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.3701","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,8,17]],"date-time":"2017-08-17T08:01:35Z","timestamp":1502956895000},"page":"e3701","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Energetics

        of echinoids in the coral-rocky reef bottoms of the Ecuadorian coast, using

        and trophic niche of the two sea urchins in the most southern coral-rocky
        reefs of the ETP in two sites with different disturbance level. Bayesian models
        were used to estimate the contribution of algal sources, niche breadth, and
        trophic overlap between the two species. The sea urchins behaved as opportunistic
        feeders, although they showed differential resource assimilation.<jats:italic>Eucidaris

        likewise, their niche amplitude was broader than that of<jats:italic>D. mexicanum<\/jats:italic>when
        conditions were not optimal. However, there was no niche overlap between the
        species. The Stable Isotope Analysis in R (SIAR) indicated that both sea urchins
        shared limiting resources in the disturbed area, mainly<jats:italic>Dictyota<\/jats:italic>spp.
        (contributions of up to 85% for<jats:italic>D. mexicanum<\/jats:italic>and
        up to 75% for<jats:italic>E. thouarsii<\/jats:italic>). The Stable Isotope
        Bayesian Ellipses in R (SIBER) analysis results indicated less interspecific
        competition in the undisturbed site. Our results suggested a trophic niche
        partitioning between sympatric sea urchin species in coastal areas of the
        ETP, but the limitation of resources could lead to trophic overlap and stronger
        habitat degradation.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.1578","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,14]],"date-time":"2016-01-14T13:55:39Z","timestamp":1452779739000},"page":"e1578","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Trophic

        communication is seen as critical for the disciplines of ecology and conservation,
        where research products are often used to shape policy and decision making.
        Scientists are increasing their online media communication, via social media
        and news. Such media engagement has been thought to influence or predict traditional
        metrics of scholarship, such as citation rates. Here, we measure the association
        between citation rates and the Altmetric Attention Score\u2014an indicator
        of the amount and reach of the attention an article has received\u2014along
        with other forms of bibliometric performance (year published, journal impact
        factor, and article type). We found that Attention Score was positively correlated
        with citation rates. However, in recent years, we detected increasing media
        exposure did not relate to the equivalent citations as in earlier years; signalling
        a diminishing return on investment. Citations correlated with journal impact
        factors up to \u223c13, but then plateaued, demonstrating that maximizing
        citations does not require publishing in the highest-impact journals. We conclude
        that ecology and conservation researchers can increase exposure of their research
        through social media engagement and, simultaneously, enhance their performance
        under traditional measures of scholarly activity.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.4564","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,12]],"date-time":"2018-04-12T11:00:46Z","timestamp":1523530846000},"page":"e4564","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Tweet

        assemblages are generally characterized by a few dominant species and numerous
        others. Such unequal distributions of dominance also emerge in human society,
        including in scientific communities. Here, based on formal community ecological
        analyses, we show the temporal trends in the number of scientific publication
        in the discipline of \u201cecology.\u201d Based on this, we infer possible
        factors causing the imbalance of reputation and dominance among countries.
        We relied on 454 ecological meta-analysis papers published from 1998 to 2014,
        which sourced over 29,000 original publications. Formal meta-analyses are
        essential for synthesizing findings from individual studies and are critical
        for assessing issues and informing policy. We found that, despite the rapid
        expansion of outlets for ecology papers (analogous to an increase in carrying
        capacity, in ecological systems), country diversity as determined from first
        author affiliations (analogous to species diversity) did not increase. Furthermore,
        a country identity was more powerful than the popularity of the scientific
        topic and affected the chance of publication in high-profile journals, independent
        of the potential novelty of findings and arguments of the papers, suggesting
        possible academic injustice. Consequently, a rank order and hierarchy has
        been gradually formed among countries. Notably, this country-dominance rank
        is not only specific to this scientific domain but also universal across different
        societal situations including sports and economics, further emphasizing that
        inequality and hierarchical structure exist even in modern human society.
        Our study demonstrates a need for having robust frameworks to facilitate equality
        and diversity in the scientific domain in order to better inform society and
        policy.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.1457","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2015,12,3]],"date-time":"2015-12-03T09:56:16Z","timestamp":1449136576000},"page":"e1457","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["Academic

        of fine-scale movement, performance, and energetics of hunting by large carnivores
        is critical for understanding the physiological underpinnings of trophic interactions.
        This is particularly challenging for wide-ranging terrestrial canid and felid
        predators, which can each affect ecosystem structure through distinct hunting
        modes. To compare free-ranging pursuit and escape performance from group-hunting
        and solitary predators in unprecedented detail, we calibrated and deployed
        accelerometer-GPS collars during predator-prey chase sequences using packs
        of hound dogs (<jats:italic>Canis lupus familiaris<\/jats:italic>, 26 kg,
        <jats:italic>n<\/jats:italic>\u00a0=\u00a04\u20135 per chase) pursuing simultaneously
        instrumented solitary pumas (<jats:italic>Puma concolor<\/jats:italic>, 60
        kg, <jats:italic>n<\/jats:italic>\u00a0=\u00a02). We then reconstructed chase
        paths, speed and turning angle profiles, and energy demands for hounds and
        pumas to examine performance and physiological constraints associated with
        cursorial and cryptic hunting modes, respectively. Interaction dynamics revealed
        how pumas successfully utilized terrain (e.g., fleeing up steep, wooded hillsides)
        as well as evasive maneuvers (e.g., jumping into trees, running in figure-8
        patterns) to increase their escape distance from the overall faster hounds
        (avg. 2.3\u00d7\u00a0faster). These adaptive strategies were essential to
        evasion in light of the mean 1.6\u00d7\u00a0higher mass-specific energetic
        costs of the chase for pumas compared to hounds (mean: 0.76 <jats:italic>vs.<\/jats:italic>

        respectively). On an instantaneous basis, escapes were more costly for pumas,
        requiring exercise at \u226590% of predicted $\\dot {\\mathrm{V }}{\\mathrm{O}}_{2\\mathrm{MAX}}$
        and consuming as much energy per minute as approximately 5\u00a0min of active
        hunting. Our results demonstrate the marked investment of energy for evasion
        by a large, solitary carnivore and the advantage of dynamic maneuvers to postpone
        being overtaken by group-hunting canids.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.3701","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,8,17]],"date-time":"2017-08-17T08:01:35Z","timestamp":1502956895000},"page":"e3701","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Energetics

        coastal reefs. This study provided a trophic scenario for these two species
        of echinoids in the coral-rocky reef bottoms of the Ecuadorian coast, using
        stable isotopes. We evaluated the relative proportion of algal resources assimilated,
        and trophic niche of the two sea urchins in the most southern coral-rocky
        reefs of the ETP in two sites with different disturbance level. Bayesian models
        were used to estimate the contribution of algal sources, niche breadth, and
        trophic overlap between the two species. The sea urchins behaved as opportunistic
        feeders, although they showed differential resource assimilation.<jats:italic>Eucidaris
        thouarsii<\/jats:italic>is the dominant species in disturbed environments;
        likewise, their niche amplitude was broader than that of<jats:italic>D. mexicanum<\/jats:italic>when
        conditions were not optimal. However, there was no niche overlap between the
        species. The Stable Isotope Analysis in R (SIAR) indicated that both sea urchins

        Bayesian Ellipses in R (SIBER) analysis results indicated less interspecific
        competition in the undisturbed site. Our results suggested a trophic niche
        partitioning between sympatric sea urchin species in coastal areas of the
        ETP, but the limitation of resources could lead to trophic overlap and stronger

        horizontal transmission favors increased costs of infection and may result
        in more virulent parasites or less beneficial mutualists. We set out to understand

        stability of this mutualism. After 20 experimental passages, infected bacteria
        from treatments with both vertical and horizontal transmission of phage had

        flaws in applying concepts from the virulence-transmission tradeoff hypothesis

        complete understanding of the feeding structures is fundamental in order to
        study how animals survive. Some birds use long and protrusible tongues as
        the main tool to collect their central caloric source (e.g., woodpeckers and
        nectarivores). Hummingbirds are the oldest and most diverse clade of nectarivorous
        vertebrates, being a perfect subject to study tongue specializations. Their
        tongue functions to intraorally transport arthropods through their long bills
        and enables them to exploit the nectarivorous niche by collecting small amounts
        of liquid, therefore it is of vital importance to study its anatomy and structure
        at various scales. I focused on the portions of the hummingbird tongue that
        have been shown to be key for understanding their feeding mechanisms. I used
        histology, transmission and scanning electron microscopy, microCT, and <jats:italic>ex-vivo<\/jats:italic>
        experiments in order to advance the comprehension of the morphology and functioning
        of the hummingbird feeding apparatus. I found that hummingbird tongues are
        composed mainly of thin cornified epithelium, lack papillae, and completely
        fill the internal cast of the rostral oropharyngeal cavity. Understanding
        this puzzle-piece match between bill and tongue will be essential for the
        study of intraoral transport of nectar. Likewise, I found that the structural
        composition and tissue architecture of the tongue groove walls provide the
        rostral portion of the tongue with elastic properties that are central to
        the study of tongue-nectar interactions during the feeding process. Detailed
        studies on hummingbirds set the basis for comparisons with other nectar-feeding
        birds and contribute to comprehend the natural solutions to collecting liquids
        in the most efficient way possible.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.3449","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,6,8]],"date-time":"2017-06-08T07:38:38Z","timestamp":1496907518000},"page":"e3449","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Relating

        decisions animals make to adjust their antipredator behavior to rapidly changing
        conditions have been well studied. Inducible defenses in plants are an antipredator
        behavior that acts on a longer time scale, but sensitive plants, <jats:italic>Mimosa
        pudica<\/jats:italic>, have a much more rapid antipredator response; they
        temporarily close their leaves when touched. The time they remain closed is
        defined as hiding time. We studied hiding time in sensitive plants and found
        that individual plants differed significantly in their hiding times. We then
        showed that the effect of individual explained substantial variation in hiding
        time on a short time scale. Finally, on a longer time scale, individuality
        persisted but the amount of variation attributed to individual decreased.
        We hypothesized that variation in plant condition might explain this change.
        We therefore manipulated sunlight availability and quantified hiding time.
        When deprived of light for 6 h, sensitive plants significantly shortened their
        hiding times. But when only half a plant was deprived of light, hiding times
        on the deprived half and light exposed half were not significantly different.
        This suggests that overall condition best explains variation in sensitive
        plant antipredator behavior. Just like in animals, sensitive plant antipredator
        behavior is condition dependent, and, just like in animals, a substantial
        amount of the remaining variation is explained by individual differences between
        plants. Thus, models designed to predict plasticity in animal behavior may
        be successfully applied to understand behavior in other organisms, including
        plants.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.3598","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,7,31]],"date-time":"2017-07-31T08:00:41Z","timestamp":1501488041000},"page":"e3598","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Sensitive

        the context for the evolution of life-history traits, habitat features constrain
        successful ecological and physiological strategies. In vertebrates, a key
        response to life\u2019s challenges is the activation of the Stress (HPA) and
        Gonadal (HPG) axes. Much of the interest in stress ecology is motivated by
        the desire to understand the physiological mechanisms in which the environment
        affects fitness. As reported in the literature, several intrinsic and extrinsic
        factors affect variability in hormone levels. In both social and non-social
        animals, the frequency and type of interaction with conspecifics, as well
        as the status in social species, can affect HPA axis activity, resulting in
        changes in the reproductive success of animals. We predicted that a social
        environment can affect both guanaco axes by increasing the secretion of testosterone
        (T) and Glucocorticoid (GCs) in response to individual social interactions
        and the energetic demands of breeding. Assuming that prolonged elevated levels
        of GCs over time can be harmful to individuals, it is predicted that the HPA
        axis suppresses the HPG axis and causes T levels to decrease, as GCs increase.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title><jats:p>All
        of the data for individuals were collected by non-invasive methods (fecal
        samples) to address hormonal activities. This is a novel approach in physiological
        ecology because feces are easily obtained through non-invasive sampling in
        animal populations.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results<\/jats:title><jats:p>As

        No significant differences were found in fecal GCs metabolites between males\/females*season

        Despite the seasonal activity variation in the hormonal profiles, our results
        show a positive correlation (<jats:italic>p<\/jats:italic>-value = 1.952e\u221211,
        COR = 0.50) between the adrenal and gonadal system. The marked endocrine (<jats:italic>r<\/jats:italic><jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.806)

        response due to seasonal variation in male guanaco individuals highlights
        the individual\u2019s energetic demands according to life-history strategies.
        This is a remarkable result because no inhibition was found between the axes
        as theory suggests. Finally, the dataset was used to build a reactive scope

        but smaller flowers with longer lifespans and produced less nectar than those
        in sympatry. Bayesian-based phylogenetic analysis indicated monophyly for<jats:italic>calyculatus<\/jats:italic>populations
        (i.e. both populations belong to the same species). In sympatry,<jats:italic>calyculatus<\/jats:italic>plants
        opened more and larger flowers with longer lifespans and produced same nectar
        volume than those of<jats:italic>auriculatus<\/jats:italic>; populations shared

        standing crops differed between sympatric populations, with lower visitation
        in<jats:italic>calyculatus<\/jats:italic>. Hand pollination experiments indicated
        a predominant outcrossing breeding system, with fruit set after interspecific
        pollination two times higher from<jats:italic>calyculatus<\/jats:italic>to<jats:italic>auriculatus<\/jats:italic>than

        indicate that isolation by hummingbird pollinators was less effective (0.20)
        than isolation by host tree species and seed dispersers (0.80 and 0.60, respectively),
        suggesting that host usage is the most important ecological isolation factor
        between the two species. Accordingly, the absolute and relative cumulative
        strength values indicated that the host tree species\u2019 barrier is currently
        contributing the most to maintaining these species in sympatry.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.2491","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,27]],"date-time":"2016-09-27T08:26:25Z","timestamp":1474964785000},"page":"e2491","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":9,"title":["Reproductive

        between populations plays a key role in the long-term persistence of species
        in fragmented habitats. This is of particular concern for biodiversity preservation
        in drylands, since water limited landscapes are typically characterized by
        little suitable habitat cover, high habitat fragmentation, harsh matrices,
        and are being rapidly degraded at a global scale. In this study, we modelled
        landscape connectivity between 11 guanaco <jats:italic>Lama guanicoe<\/jats:italic>
        populations in Chile\u2019s arid Norte Chico, a region that supports the last
        remnant coastal populations of this emblematic herbivore indigenous to South
        America. We produced a habitat suitability model to derive a regional surface
        resistance map, and used circuit theory to map functional connectivity, investigate
        the relative isolation between populations, and identify those that contribute
        most to the patch connectivity network. Predicted suitable habitat for <jats:italic>L.\u00a0guanicoe<\/jats:italic>
        represented about 25% of the study region (i.e., 29,173 km<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup>)
        and was heterogeneously distributed along a continuous stretch along the Andes,
        and discontinuous patches along the coast. As a result, we found that high
        connectivity current flows in the mid and high Andes formed a wide, continuous
        connectivity corridor, enabling connectivity between all high Andean populations.
        Coastal populations, in contrast, were more isolated. These groups demonstrate
        no inter-population connectivity between themselves, only with higher altitude
        populations, and for two of them, animal movement was linked to the effectiveness
        of wildlife crossings along the Pan-American highway. Our results indicate
        that functional connectivity is an issue of concern for <jats:italic>L. guanicoe<\/jats:italic>
        in Chile\u2019s Norte Chico, implying that future conservation and management
        plans should emphasize strategies aimed at conserving functional connectivity
        between coastal and Andean populations, as well as the protection of habitat
        patches likely to act as stepping stones within the connectivity network.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.4429","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,2]],"date-time":"2018-03-02T09:03:49Z","timestamp":1519981429000},"page":"e4429","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Landscape

        the Ceratopogonidae family, many genera transmit numerous diseases to humans
        and animals, while others are important pollinators of tropical crops. In
        the Yungas ecoregion of Argentina, previous systematic and ecological research
        on Ceratopogonidae focused on <jats:italic>Culicoides<\/jats:italic>, since
        they are the main transmitters of mansonelliasis in northwestern Argentina;
        however, few studies included the genera <jats:italic>Forcipomyia<\/jats:italic>,
        <jats:italic>Dasyhelea<\/jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Atrichopogon<\/jats:italic>,
        <jats:italic>Alluaudomyia<\/jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Echinohelea<\/jats:italic>,
        and <jats:italic>Bezzia<\/jats:italic>. Therefore, the objective of this study
        was to determine the presence and abundance of Ceratopogonidae in this region,
        their association with meteorological variables, and their variation in areas
        disturbed by human activity. Monthly collection of specimens was performed
        from July 2008 to July 2009 using CDC miniature light traps deployed for two
        consecutive days. A total of 360 specimens were collected, being the most
        abundant <jats:italic>Dasyhelea<\/jats:italic> genus (48.06%) followed by
        <jats:italic>Forcipomyia<\/jats:italic> (26.94%) and <jats:italic>Atrichopogon<\/jats:italic>
        (13.61%). Bivariate analyses showed significant differences in the abundance
        of the genera at different sampling sites and climatic conditions, with the
        summer season and El Corralito site showing the greatest abundance of specimens.
        Accumulated rainfall was the variable that related the most to the abundance
        of <jats:italic>Culicoides<\/jats:italic> (10.56%), while temperature was
        the most closely related variable to the abundance of <jats:italic>Forcipomyia<\/jats:italic>,
        <jats:italic>Dasyhelea<\/jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>Atrichopogon<\/jats:italic>.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.2655","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,11,17]],"date-time":"2016-11-17T09:42:43Z","timestamp":1479375763000},"page":"e2655","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Ceratopogonidae

        representation genomic datasets are increasingly becoming available from a
        variety of organisms. These datasets do not target specific genes, and so
        may contain sequences from parasites and other organisms present in the target
        tissue sample. In this paper, we demonstrate that (1) RADseq datasets can
        be used for exploratory analysis of tissue-specific metagenomes, and (2) tissue
        collections house complete metagenomic communities, which can be investigated
        and quantified by a variety of techniques.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>We
        present an exploratory method for mining metagenomic \u201cbycatch\u201d sequences
        from a range of host tissue types. We use a combination of the pyRAD assembly
        pipeline, NCBI\u2019s blastn software, and custom R scripts to isolate metagenomic
        sequences from RADseq type datasets.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>When
        we focus on sequences that align with existing references in NCBI\u2019s GenBank,
        we find that between three and five percent of identifiable double-digest
        restriction site associated DNA (ddRAD) sequences from host tissue samples
        are from phyla to contain known blood parasites. In addition to tissue samples,
        we examine ddRAD sequences from metagenomic DNA extracted snake and lizard
        hind-gut samples. We find that the sequences recovered from these samples
        match with expected bacterial and eukaryotic gut microbiome phyla.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Discussion<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>Our
        results suggest that (1) museum tissue banks originally collected for host
        DNA archiving are also preserving valuable parasite and microbiome communities,
        (2) that publicly available RADseq datasets may include metagenomic sequences
        that could be explored, and (3) that restriction site approaches are a useful
        exploratory technique to identify microbiome lineages that could be missed

        ecological niche modeling (ENM) was applied. Species richness and the distribution

        based on squares of 5\u00b0 latitude and longitude while similarities among

        are well separated based on ecological niche modeling analysis. Their distribution
        is limited mainly by the isothermality and temperature seasonality. The highest<jats:italic>Psilochilus<\/jats:italic>species
        richness is observed in the North Andean, Panamanian, Brazilian Planalto and
        Central American biogeographical provinces. A high level of endemism is observed
