        science ontologies play an important role in Semantic Web. Given the diversity
        in fish species and the associated wealth of information, it is imperative
        to develop an ontology capable of linking and integrating this information
        in an automated fashion. As such, we introduce the Fish Ontology (FO), an
        automated classification architecture of existing fish taxa which provides
        taxonomic information on unknown fish based on metadata restrictions. It is
        designed to support knowledge discovery, provide semantic annotation of fish
        and fisheries resources, data integration, and information retrieval. Automated
        classification for unknown specimens is a unique feature that currently does
        not appear to exist in other known ontologies. Examples of automated classification
        for major groups of fish are demonstrated, showing the inferred information
        by introducing several restrictions at the species or specimen level. The
        current version of FO has 1,830 classes, includes widely used fisheries terminology,
        and models major aspects of fish taxonomy, grouping, and character. With more
        than 30,000 known fish species globally, the FO will be an indispensable tool
        for fish scientists and other interested\u00a0users.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.3811","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,15]],"date-time":"2017-09-15T08:06:53Z","timestamp":1505462813000},"page":"e3811","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Fish

        grazing strongly controls periphyton biomass. The question therefore arises
        whether benthic grazing could be used as a tool to reduce excessive growth
        of periphyton in nutrient-enriched rivers. Although benthic invertebrate grazers
        reduce the growth of periphyton, this is highly context dependent. Here we
        assessed whether the only obligate herbivorous fish in European rivers, the
        common nase (<jats:italic>Chondrostoma nasus<\/jats:italic> L.), is able to
        reduce periphyton biomass in a eutrophic river. We conducted three consecutive
        <jats:italic>in situ<\/jats:italic> experiments at low, intermediate and high
        densities of nase in the river using standard tiles on the river bottom naturally
        covered with periphyton that were accessible to fish and tiles that excluded
        fish foraging with electric exclosures. The biomass of benthic invertebrate
        grazers was very low relative to nase. We hypothesised that nase would reduce
        periphyton biomass on accessible tiles and therefore expected higher periphyton
        biomass on the exclosure tiles, at least at intermediate and high densities
        of nase in the river. Contrary to our expectation, the impact of fish grazing
        was low even at high fish density, as judged by the significantly lower chlorophyll
        <jats:italic>a<\/jats:italic> concentration on exclosure tiles even though
        the ash-free dry mass on accessible and exclosure tiles did not differ. The
        lower chlorophyll <jats:italic>a<\/jats:italic> concentrations on exclosure
        tiles might be explained by a higher biomass of invertebrate grazers on the
        exclosure tiles, which would indicate that the effect of invertebrate grazers
        was stronger than that of herbivorous fish grazers. The high biomass of invertebrate
        grazers on exclosure tiles likely arose from the exclusion of zoobenthivorous
        fish, which occur in the river at high densities. The results of our small-scale
        experiments suggested that cascading top-down effects of zoobenthivorous fish
        have a higher impact on periphyton biomass than direct effects of herbivorous

        spatial learning skills of high and low stress juvenile mulloway (<jats:italic>Argyrosomus
        japonicus<\/jats:italic>) were tested in a dichotomous choice apparatus. Groups
        of fish were formed based on background blood cortisol levels and required
        to learn the location of a food reward hidden in one of two compartments.
        Low stress fish characterised by low background levels of the stress hormone
        cortisol had higher activity levels and entered both rewarded and unrewarded
        rooms frequently. Within the first week of exposure, however, their preference
        for the rewarded room increased, indicative of learning. Fish that had high
        background levels of cortisol, in contrast, showed low levels of activity
        but when they chose between the two rooms they chose the rewarded room most
        often but showed less improvement over time. After 12 days in the apparatus,
        both low and high stress fish had similar ratios of rewarded vs unrewarded
        room entrances. Our results suggest that proactive coping styles may increase
        exposure to novel contexts and thus favour faster learning but at the cost
        of reduced initial accuracy.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.3445","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,6,8]],"date-time":"2017-06-08T07:38:02Z","timestamp":1496907482000},"page":"e3445","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Stress

        abundance estimates for species are fundamental in ecology, fisheries, and
        conservation. Consequently, predictive models able to provide reliable estimates
        for un- or poorly-surveyed locations would prove a valuable tool for management.
        Based on commonly used environmental and physical predictors, we developed
        predictive models of total fish abundance and of abundance by fish family
        for ten representative taxonomic families for the Great Barrier Reef (GBR)
        using multiple temporal scenarios. We then tested if models developed for
        the GBR (reference system) could predict fish abundances at Ningaloo Reef
        (NR; target system), i.e., if these GBR models could be successfully transferred
        to NR. Models of abundance by fish family resulted in improved performance
        (e.g., 44.1% &lt;<jats:italic>R<\/jats:italic><jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup>\u00a0&lt;\u00a050.6%
        for Acanthuridae) compared to total fish abundance (9% &lt;<jats:italic>R<\/jats:italic><jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup>\u00a0&lt;\u00a018.6%).
        However, in contrast with previous transferability obtained for similar models
        for fish species richness from the GBR to NR, transferability for these fish
        abundance models was poor. When compared with observations of fish abundance
        collected in NR, our transferability results had low validation scores (<jats:italic>R<\/jats:italic><jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup>\u00a0&lt;\u00a06%,
        <jats:italic>p<\/jats:italic>\u00a0&gt;\u00a00.05). High spatio-temporal variability
        of patterns in fish abundance at the family and population levels in both
        reef systems likely affected the transferability of these models. Inclusion
        of additional predictors with potential direct effects on abundance, such
        as local fishing effort or topographic complexity, may improve transferability
        of fish abundance models. However, observations of these local-scale predictors
        are often not available, and might thereby hinder studies on model transferability
        and its usefulness for conservation planning and management.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.4566","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,17]],"date-time":"2018-04-17T07:17:42Z","timestamp":1523949462000},"page":"e4566","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Challenges

        the spread of sushi restaurants in the European Union and United States is
        a relatively new phenomenon, they have rapidly become among the most popular
        food services globally. Recent studies indicate that they can be associated
        with very high levels (&gt;70%) of fish species substitution. Based on indications
        that the European seafood retail sector may currently be under better control
        than its North American counterpart, here we investigated levels of seafood
        labelling accuracy in sushi bars and restaurants across England. We used the
        COI barcoding gene to screen samples of tuna, eel, and a variety of other
        products characterised by less visually distinctive \u2018white flesh\u2019.
        Moderate levels of substitution were found (10%), significantly lower than
        observed in North America, which lends support to the argument that public
        awareness, policy and governance of seafood labels is more effective in the
        European Union. Nevertheless, the results highlight that current labelling
        practice in UK restaurants lags behind the level of detail implemented in
        the retail sector, which hinders consumer choice, with potentially damaging
        economic, health and environmental consequences. Specifically, critically
        endangered species of tuna and eel continue to be sold without adequate information
        to consumers.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.1891","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,31]],"date-time":"2016-03-31T11:02:28Z","timestamp":1459422148000},"page":"e1891","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":9,"title":["Sushi

        addition to hypopigmentation of the skin and red iris colouration, albino
        animals also display distinct physiological and behavioural alterations. However,
        information on the social interactions of albino animals is rare and has mostly
        been limited to specially bred strains of albino rodents and animals from
        unique environments in caves. Differentiating between the effects of albinism
        and domestication on behaviour in rodents can be difficult, and social behaviour
        in cave fish changes according to species-specific adaptations to conditions
        of permanent darkness. The agonistic behaviours of albino offspring of pigmented
        parents have yet to be described. In this study, we observed agonistic behaviour
        in albino and pigmented juvenile<jats:italic>Silurus glanis<\/jats:italic>catfish.
        We found that the total number of aggressive interactions was lower in albinos
        than in pigmented catfish. The distance between conspecifics was also analysed,
        and albinos showed a tendency towards greater separation from their same-coloured
        conspecifics compared with pigmented catfish. These results demonstrate that
        albinism can be associated with lower aggressiveness and with reduced shoaling
        behaviour preference, as demonstrated by a tendency towards greater separation
        of albinos from conspecifics.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.1937","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,18]],"date-time":"2016-04-18T08:39:17Z","timestamp":1460968757000},"page":"e1937","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["How

        prior evidence of nutritional programming influencing behavior and juvenile

        biofiltration is a widely used approach for the mitigation of aquaculture
        water. In this study, we investigated the effect of mussel biofiltration on
        the communities of particle-associated bacteria and unicellular eukaryotes
        in a sea bass aquaculture in southern North Sea. We assessed the planktonic
        community changes before and after biofiltration based on the diversity of
        the 16S and 18S rRNA genes by using next generation sequencing technologies.
        Although there was no overall reduction in the operational taxonomic units
        (OTU) numbers between the control (no mussels) and the test (with mussels)
        tanks, a clear reduction in the relative abundance of the top three most dominant
        OTUs in every sampling time was observed, ranging between 2\u201328% and 16\u201382%
        for Bacteria and Eukarya, respectively. The bacterial community was dominated
        by OTUs related to phytoplankton blooms and\/or high concentrations of detritus.
        Among the eukaryotes, several fungal and parasitic groups were found. Their
        relative abundance in most cases was also reduced from the control to the
        test tanks; a similar decreasing pattern was also observed for both major
        higher taxa and functional (trophic) groups. Overall, this study showed the
        effectiveness of mussel biofiltration on the decrease of microbiota abundance

        consumption of raw fish has increased considerably in the West, since it is
        said to be potentially healthier than processed fish (for containing omega
        3 and 6, essential amino acids and vitamins). However this potential benefit,
        as well as the taste, value and even the risk of extinction are not the same
        for all species of fish, constituting grounds for fraud. Using the principles
        of the DNA barcode we revealed mislabelling of fish in Japanese restaurants
        and fishmarkets in Florian\u00f3polis, a popular tourist capital in Brazil.
        We sequenced the COI gene of 65 samples from fisheries and 80 from restaurants
        and diagnosed 30% of mislabeled samples in fisheries and 26% in restaurants.
        We discussed that frauds may have occurred for different reasons: to circumvent
        surveillance on threatened species; to sell fish with sizes smaller than allowed
        or abundant species as being a much rarer species (law of supply); to induce
        product consumption using species with better taste. It should be noted that
        some substitutions are derived from incorrect identification and are not a
        fraud <jats:italic>per se<\/jats:italic>; they are due to confusion of popular
        names or misunderstanding by the sellers. Therefore, we suggest the implementation
        of a systematic regulatory program conducted by governmental agencies to reduce
        mislabelling in order to avoid further damage to the community (in health
        and financial issues) and fish stocks.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.4006","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,11,29]],"date-time":"2017-11-29T09:04:01Z","timestamp":1511946241000},"page":"e4006","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["DNA

        communication requires that signals are well transmitted and perceived in
        a given environment. Natural selection therefore drives the evolution of different
        signals in different environments. In addition, environmental heterogeneity
        at small spatial or temporal scales may favour phenotypic plasticity in signaling
        traits, as plasticity may allow rapid adjustment of signal expression to optimize
        transmission. In this study, we explore signal plasticity in the nuptial coloration
        of Lake Victoria cichlids, <jats:italic>Pundamilia pundamilia<\/jats:italic>
        and <jats:italic>Pundamilia nyererei.<\/jats:italic> These two species differ
        in male coloration, which mediates species-assortative mating. They occur
        in adjacent depth ranges with different light environments. Given the close
        proximity of their habitats, overlapping at some locations, plasticity in
        male coloration could contribute to male reproductive success but interfere
        with reproductive isolation.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>We

        and their hybrids under light conditions mimicking the two depth ranges in
        Lake Victoria. From photographs, we quantified the nuptial coloration of males,
        spanning the entire visible spectrum. In experiment 1, we examined developmental
        colour plasticity by comparing sibling males reared in each light condition.
        In experiment 2, we assessed colour plasticity in adulthood, by switching
        adult males between conditions and tracking coloration for 100 days.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>We
        found that nuptial colour in <jats:italic>Pundamilia<\/jats:italic> did respond
        plastically to our light manipulations, but only in a limited hue range. Fish
        that were reared in light conditions mimicking the deeper habitat were significantly
        greener than those in conditions mimicking shallow waters. The species-specific
        nuptial colours (blue and red) did not change. When moved to the opposing
        light condition as adults, males did not change colour.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title>Discussion<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Our
        results show that species-specific nuptial colours, which are subject to strong
        divergent selection by female choice, are not plastic. We do find plasticity
        in green coloration, a response that may contribute to visual conspicuousness
        in darker, red-shifted light environments. These results suggest that light-environment-induced
        plasticity in male nuptial coloration in <jats:italic>P. pundamilia<\/jats:italic>
        and<jats:italic> P. nyererei<\/jats:italic> is limited and does not interfere

        coral ecosystems (MCEs) continue to be understudied, especially in island
        locations spread across the Indo-Pacific Ocean. Pohnpei is the largest island
        in the Federated States of Micronesia, with a well-developed barrier reef,
        and steep slopes that descend to more than 1,000 m. Here we conducted visual
        surveys along a depth gradient of 0 to 60\u00a0m in addition to video surveys
        that extend to 130\u00a0m, with 72 belt transects and 12 roving surveys using
        closed-circuit rebreathers, to test for changes in reef fish composition from
        shallow to mesophotic depths. We observed 304 fish species across 47 families
        with the majority confined to shallow habitat. Taxonomic and trophic positions
        at 30\u00a0m showed similar compositions when compared against all other depths.
        However, assemblages were comprised of a distinct shallow (&lt;30\u00a0m)
        and deep (&gt;30\u00a0m) group, suggesting 30\u00a0m as a transition zone
        between these communities. Shallow specialists had a high probability of being
        herbivores and deep specialists had a higher probability of being planktivores.
        Acanthuridae (surgeonfishes), Holocentridae (soldierfishes), and Labridae
        (wrasses) were associated primarily with shallow habitat, while Pomacentridae
        (damselfishes) and Serranidae (groupers) were associated with deep habitat.
        Four species may indicate Central Pacific mesophotic habitat: <jats:italic>Chromis
        circumaurea, Luzonichthys seaver, Odontanthias borbonius,<\/jats:italic> and
        an undescribed slopefish (<jats:italic>Symphysanodon sp.<\/jats:italic>).
        This study supports the 30 m depth profile as a transition zone between shallow
        and mesophotic ecosystems (consistent with accepted definitions of MCEs),
        with evidence of multiple transition zones below 30\u00a0m. Disturbances restricted
        to either region are not likely to immediately impact the other and both ecosystems
        should be considered separately in management of reefs near human population
        centers.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.4650","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,24]],"date-time":"2018-04-24T07:50:32Z","timestamp":1524556232000},"page":"e4650","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Shifting
