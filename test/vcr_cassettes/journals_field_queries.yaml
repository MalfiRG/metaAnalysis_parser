        the spread of sushi restaurants in the European Union and United States is
        a relatively new phenomenon, they have rapidly become among the most popular
        food services globally. Recent studies indicate that they can be associated
        with very high levels (&gt;70%) of fish species substitution. Based on indications
        that the European seafood retail sector may currently be under better control
        than its North American counterpart, here we investigated levels of seafood
        labelling accuracy in sushi bars and restaurants across England. We used the
        COI barcoding gene to screen samples of tuna, eel, and a variety of other
        products characterised by less visually distinctive \u2018white flesh\u2019.
        Moderate levels of substitution were found (10%), significantly lower than
        observed in North America, which lends support to the argument that public
        awareness, policy and governance of seafood labels is more effective in the
        European Union. Nevertheless, the results highlight that current labelling
        practice in UK restaurants lags behind the level of detail implemented in
        the retail sector, which hinders consumer choice, with potentially damaging
        economic, health and environmental consequences. Specifically, critically
        endangered species of tuna and eel continue to be sold without adequate information
        to consumers.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.1891","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,31]],"date-time":"2016-03-31T11:02:28Z","timestamp":1459422148000},"page":"e1891","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Sushi

        addition to hypopigmentation of the skin and red iris colouration, albino
        animals also display distinct physiological and behavioural alterations. However,
        information on the social interactions of albino animals is rare and has mostly
        been limited to specially bred strains of albino rodents and animals from
        unique environments in caves. Differentiating between the effects of albinism
        and domestication on behaviour in rodents can be difficult, and social behaviour
        in cave fish changes according to species-specific adaptations to conditions

        spatial learning skills of high and low stress juvenile mulloway (<jats:italic>Argyrosomus

        of fish were formed based on background blood cortisol levels and required
        to learn the location of a food reward hidden in one of two compartments.
        Low stress fish characterised by low background levels of the stress hormone
        cortisol had higher activity levels and entered both rewarded and unrewarded
        rooms frequently. Within the first week of exposure, however, their preference
        for the rewarded room increased, indicative of learning. Fish that had high
        background levels of cortisol, in contrast, showed low levels of activity
        but when they chose between the two rooms they chose the rewarded room most
        often but showed less improvement over time. After 12 days in the apparatus,
        both low and high stress fish had similar ratios of rewarded vs unrewarded
        room entrances. Our results suggest that proactive coping styles may increase
        exposure to novel contexts and thus favour faster learning but at the cost
        of reduced initial accuracy.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.3445","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,6,8]],"date-time":"2017-06-08T07:38:02Z","timestamp":1496907482000},"page":"e3445","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Stress

        lionfish are assumed to significantly affect Caribbean reef fish communities.
        However, evidence of lionfish effects on native reef fishes is based on uncontrolled
        observational studies or small-scale, unrepresentative experiments, with findings
        ranging from no effect to large effects on prey density and richness. Moreover,
        whether lionfish affect populations and communities of native reef fishes
        at larger, management-relevant scales is unknown. The purpose of this study
        was to assess the effects of lionfish on coral reef prey fish communities
        in a natural complex reef system. We quantified lionfish and the density,
        richness, and composition of native prey fishes (0\u201310 cm total length)
        at sixteen reefs along \u223c250 km of the Belize Barrier Reef from 2009 to
        2013. Lionfish invaded our study sites during this four-year longitudinal
        study, thus our sampling included fish community structure before and after
        our sites were invaded, i.e., we employed a modified BACI design. We found
        no evidence that lionfish measurably affected the density, richness, or composition
        of prey fishes. It is possible that higher lionfish densities are necessary
        to detect an effect of lionfish on prey populations at this relatively large
        spatial scale. Alternatively, negative effects of lionfish on prey could be
        small, essentially undetectable, and ecologically insignificant at our study
        sites. Other factors that influence the dynamics of reef fish populations
        including reef complexity, resource availability, recruitment, predation,
        and fishing could swamp any effects of lionfish on prey populations.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.3270","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,25]],"date-time":"2017-05-25T08:03:11Z","timestamp":1495699391000},"page":"e3270","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Invasive

        areas. There exists large variation in the geological and oceanographic environment
        among the thousands of locations that fall within the broad definition of
        seamount. Global seamount surveys have revealed that not all seamounts are
        hotspots of biodiversity, and there remains a strong need to understand the
        mechanisms that underlie variation in species richness observed. We examined
        the process of fish species assembly at El Bajo Espiritu Santo (EBES) seamount
        in the Gulf of California over a five-year study period. To effectively quantify
        the relative abundance of fast-moving and schooling fishes in a \u2018blue
        water\u2019 habitat, we developed a simplified underwater visual census (UVC)
        methodology and analysis framework suitable for this setting and applicable
        to future studies in similar environments. We found correlations between seasonally
        changing community structure and variability in oceanographic conditions.
        Individual species responses to thermal habitat at EBES revealed three distinct
        assemblages, a \u2018fall assemblage\u2019 tracking warmer overall temperature,
        a \u2018spring assemblage\u2019 correlated with cooler temperature, and a
        \u2018year-round assemblage\u2019 with no significant response to temperature.
        Species richness was greatest in spring, when cool and warm water masses stratified
        the water column and a greater number of species from all three assemblages
        co-occurred. We discuss our findings in the context of potential mechanisms
        that could account for predator biodiversity at shallow seamounts.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.2357","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,6]],"date-time":"2016-09-06T08:10:10Z","timestamp":1473149410000},"page":"e2357","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Seasonal

        is well studied in ecology and the concept has been developed to include traits
        of species, rather than solely taxonomy, to better reflect the functional
        diversity of a system. The deep sea provides a natural environmental gradient
        within which to study changes in different diversity metrics, but traits of
        deep-sea fish are not widely known, hampering the application of functional
        diversity to this globally important system. We used morphological traits
        to determine the functional richness and functional divergence of demersal
        fish assemblages along the continental slope in the Northeast Atlantic, at
        depths of 300\u20132,000 m. We compared these metrics to size diversity based
        on individual body size and species richness. Functional richness and size
        diversity showed similar patterns, with the highest diversity at intermediate
        depths; functional divergence showed the opposite pattern, with the highest
        values at the shallowest and deepest parts of the study site. Species richness
        increased with depth. The functional implications of these patterns were deduced
        by examining depth-related changes in morphological traits and the dominance
        of feeding guilds as illustrated by stable isotope analyses. The patterns
        in diversity and the variation in certain morphological traits can potentially
        be explained by changes in the relative dominance of pelagic and benthic feeding
        guilds. All measures of diversity examined here suggest that the deep areas
        of the continental slope may be equally or more diverse than assemblages just
        beyond the continental shelf.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.2387","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,15]],"date-time":"2016-09-15T07:50:51Z","timestamp":1473925851000},"page":"e2387","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Functional,

        seabass (<jats:italic>Lates calcarifer<\/jats:italic>) is a food fish of increasing
        aquaculture importance. In order to improve our understanding on the digestive
        system and feeding of this species, morphological and histological features
        of the gut were studied. Morphologically, the Asian seabass gut is defined
        by a short and muscular esophagus, well-developed stomach and comparatively
        short intestine. Mucous secreting goblet cells reactive to PAS (Periodic Acid
        Schiff) and AB (Alcian Blue) stain were present throughout the esophagus.
        The stomach was sac-like and could be distinguished into the cardiac, fundic
        and pyloric regions. Gastric glands and mucus cells were predominately present
        in the cardiac and fundic regions. Five finger-like pyloric caeca were present
        between the stomach and intestine. The intestine was a short, tubular structure
        with no morphological differences between the various regions. Histologically,
        the intestinal regions were similar, the main difference being in the number
        of goblet cells that increased from anterior to posterior intestine, with
        114 \u00b1 9, 153 \u00b1 7 and 317 \u00b1 21 goblet cells in the anterior,
        mid and posterior regions, respectively. The intestinal epithelium stained
        positively for PAS, but the staining was stronger for acidic glycoproteins.
        The rectum was similar to intestine, except for increased goblet cell numbers
        (anterior rectum: 529 \u00b1 26; posterior rectum: 745 \u00b1 29). Gut morpho-histology
        did not respond to salinity changes, however, there was a significant reduction
        of mucosal height, goblet cell numbers and muscularis thickness upon food
        deprivation.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.2377","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,8,24]],"date-time":"2016-08-24T09:19:31Z","timestamp":1472030371000},"page":"e2377","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Morpho-histological

        disturbances can cause rapid degradation of coral reef communities, but what
        baseline changes in species assemblages occur on undisturbed reefs through
        time? We surveyed live coral cover, reef fish abundance and fish species richness
        in 1997 and again in 2007 on 47 fringing patch reefs of varying size and depth
        at Mersa Bareika, Ras Mohammed National Park, Egypt. No major human or natural
        disturbance event occurred between these two survey periods in this remote
        protected area. In the absence of large disturbances, we found that live coral
        cover, reef fish abundance and fish species richness did not differ in 1997
        compared to 2007. Fish abundance and species richness on patches was largely
        related to the presence of shelters (caves and\/or holes), live coral cover
        and patch size (volume). The presence of the ectoparasite-eating cleaner wrasse,<jats:italic>Labroides
        dimidiatus<\/jats:italic>, was also positively related to fish species richness.
        Our results underscore the importance of physical reef characteristics, such
        as patch size and shelter availability, in addition to biotic characteristics,
        such as live coral cover and cleaner wrasse abundance, in supporting reef

        persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic pollutants (PBTs) are well-studied individually,
        their distribution and variability on a global scale are largely unknown,
        particularly in marine fish. Using 2,662 measurements collected from peer-reviewed
        literature spanning 1969\u20132012, we examined variability of five classes
        of PBTs, considering effects of geography, habitat, and trophic level on observed
        concentrations. While we see large-scale spatial patterning in some PBTs (chlordanes,
        polychlorinated biphenyls), habitat type and trophic level did not contribute
        to significant patterning, with the exception of mercury. We further examined
        patterns of change in PBT concentration as a function of sampling year. All
        PBTs showed significant declines in concentration levels through time, ranging
        from 15\u201330% reduction per decade across PBT groups. Despite consistent
        evidence of reductions, variation in pollutant concentration remains high,
        indicating ongoing consumer risk of exposure to fish with pollutant levels
        exceeding EPA screening values. The temporal trends indicate that mitigation
        programs are effective, but that global levels decline slowly. In order for
        monitoring efforts to provide more targeted assessments of risk to PBT exposure,

        ecological information is critical as a sound basis for spatial management
        and conservation and as support for ongoing research in relatively unstudied
        areas. We conducted visual surveys of fish and benthic communities on nine
        reefs (3\u201324 km from shore) in the Thuwal area of the central Saudi Arabian
        Red Sea. Fish biomass increased with increasing distance from shore, but was
        generally low compared to reefs experiencing minimal human influence around
        the world. All reefs had a herbivore-dominated trophic structure and few top
        predators, such as sharks, jacks, or large groupers. Coral cover was considerably
        lower on inshore reefs, likely due to a 2010 bleaching event. Community analyses
        showed inshore reefs to be characterized by turf algae, slower-growing corals,
        lower herbivore diversity, and highly abundant turf-farming damselfishes.
        Offshore reefs had more planktivorous fishes, a more diverse herbivore assemblage,
        and faster-growing corals<jats:italic>.<\/jats:italic> All reefs appear to
        be impacted by overfishing, and inshore reefs seem more vulnerable to thermal
        bleaching. The study provides a description of the spatial variation in biomass
        and community structure in the central Saudi Arabian Red Sea and provides
        a basis for spatial prioritization and subsequent marine protected area design

        the worldwide trend of coral reef degeneration is a major challenge for the
        scientific community. A crucial management approach to minimizing stress effects
        on healthy reefs and helping the recovery of disturbed reefs is reef protection.
        However, the current rapid decline of the world\u2019s reefs suggests that
        protection might be insufficient as a viable stand-alone management approach
        for some reefs. We thus suggest that the ecological restoration of coral reefs
        (CRR) should be considered as a valid component of coral reef management,
        in addition to protection, if the applied method is economically applicable
        and scalable. This theoretical study examines the potential applicability
        and outcomes of restocking grazers as a restoration tool for coral reef recovery\u2014a
        tool that has not been applied so far in reef restoration projects. We studied
        the effect of restocking grazing fish as a restoration method using a mathematical
        model of degrading reefs, and analyzed the financial outcomes of the restocking
        intervention. The results suggest that applying this restoration method, in
        addition to protection, can facilitate reef recovery. Moreover, our analysis
        suggests that the restocking approach almost always becomes profitable within
        several years. Considering the relatively low cost of this restoration approach
        and the feasibility of mass production of herbivorous fish, we suggest that
        this approach should be considered and examined as an additional viable restoration
        tool for coral reefs.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.1732","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,29]],"date-time":"2016-02-29T08:57:38Z","timestamp":1456736258000},"page":"e1732","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Potential

        is a well-known human disease caused by anisakid larvae belonging to the genus<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova<\/jats:italic>.
        Human infection occurs after consuming infected fish. Hence the presence of<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova<\/jats:italic>larvae
        in the flesh of the fish can cause serious losses and problems for the seafood,
        fishing and fisheries industries. The accurate identification of<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova<\/jats:italic>larvae
        in fish is important, but challenging because the larval stages of a number
        of different genera, including<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova<\/jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>and<jats:italic>Pulchrascaris<\/jats:italic>,
        look similar and cannot be differentiated from each other using morphological
        criteria, hence they are all referred to as<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>larval
        type. Given that<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>larval types in seafood
        are not necessarily<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova<\/jats:italic>and may not
        be dangerous, the aim of the present study was to investigate the occurrence
        of<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>larval types in Australian marine fish
        and to determine their specific identity. A total of 137 fish belonging to
        45 species were examined.<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>larval types
        were found in 13 species, some of which were popular edible fish in Australia.
        The sequences of the first and second internal transcribed spacers (ITS-1
        and ITS-2 respectively) of the<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>larvae
        in the present study showed a high degree of similarity suggesting that they
        all belong to the same species. Due to the lack of a comparable sequence data
        of a well identified adult in the GenBank database the specific identity of<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>larval
        type in the present study remains unknown. The sequence of the ITS regions
        of the<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>larval type in the present study
        and those of<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova<\/jats:italic>spp. available in GenBank
        are significantly different, suggesting that larvae found in the present study
        do not belong to the genus<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova<\/jats:italic>, which
        is zoonotic. This study does not rule out the presence of<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova<\/jats:italic>larvae
        in Australian fish as<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova decipiens E<\/jats:italic>has
        been reported in adult form from seals in Antarctica and it is known that
        they have seasonal presence in Australian southern coasts. The genetic distinction
        of<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>larval type in the present study from<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova<\/jats:italic>spp.
        along with the presence of more species of elasmobranchs in Australian waters
        (definitive hosts of<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>spp. and<jats:italic>Pulchrascaris<\/jats:italic>spp.)
        than seals (definitive hosts of<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova<\/jats:italic>spp.)
        suggest that<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>larval type in the present
        study belong to either genus<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>or<jats:italic>Pulchrascaris<\/jats:italic>,
        which are not known to cause disease in humans. The present study provides
        essential information that could be helpful to identify Australian<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>larval
        types in future studies. Examination and characterisation of further specimens,
        especially adults of<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>and<jats:italic>Pulchrascaris<\/jats:italic>,
        is necessary to fully elucidate the identity of these larvae.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.1722","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,15]],"date-time":"2016-03-15T08:31:49Z","timestamp":1458030709000},"page":"e1722","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Occurrence

        is one of the key factors governing patterns in natural systems, and adjustments
        of prey behaviors in response to a predator stimulus can have important ecological
        implications for wild fish. To investigate the effects of predators on the
        behavior of prey fish and to test whether the possible effects varied with
        predator size, black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus) and snakehead (Channa argus)
        (a size-matched predator treatment with a similar body size to prey fish and
        a larger predator treatment with approximately 2.7 times of the body mass
        of prey fish) were selected to function as prey and predator, respectively.
        Their spontaneous activities were videorecorded in a central circular arena
        surrounded by a ring holding the stimulus fish. The distance between prey
        and predator fish was approximately 200% of the distance between two prey
        fish, which suggested that black carp can distinguish their conspecifics from
        heterospecifics and probably recognize the snakehead as a potential predator.
        The prey fish spent substantially less time moving and exhibited an overall
        shorter total distance of movement after the size-matched or large predator
        was introduced, which possibly occurred due to increased vigilance or efforts
        to reduce the possibility of detection by potential predators. However, there
        was no significant difference in either distance or spontaneous activities
        between two predator treatments. These findings suggested that (1) an anti-predator
        strategy in black carp might involve maintaining a safe distance, decreasing
        activity and possibly increased vigilance and that (2) the behaviors of prey
        response to predators were not influenced by their relative size difference.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.3222","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,4,20]],"date-time":"2017-04-20T08:11:51Z","timestamp":1492675911000},"page":"e3222","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The
