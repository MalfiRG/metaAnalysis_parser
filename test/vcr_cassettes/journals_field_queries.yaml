        science ontologies play an important role in Semantic Web. Given the diversity
        in fish species and the associated wealth of information, it is imperative
        to develop an ontology capable of linking and integrating this information
        in an automated fashion. As such, we introduce the Fish Ontology (FO), an
        automated classification architecture of existing fish taxa which provides
        taxonomic information on unknown fish based on metadata restrictions. It is
        designed to support knowledge discovery, provide semantic annotation of fish
        and fisheries resources, data integration, and information retrieval. Automated
        classification for unknown specimens is a unique feature that currently does
        not appear to exist in other known ontologies. Examples of automated classification
        for major groups of fish are demonstrated, showing the inferred information
        by introducing several restrictions at the species or specimen level. The
        current version of FO has 1,830 classes, includes widely used fisheries terminology,
        and models major aspects of fish taxonomy, grouping, and character. With more
        than 30,000 known fish species globally, the FO will be an indispensable tool
        for fish scientists and other interested\u00a0users.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.3811","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,15]],"date-time":"2017-09-15T08:06:53Z","timestamp":1505462813000},"page":"e3811","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Fish

        of fish were formed based on background blood cortisol levels and required
        to learn the location of a food reward hidden in one of two compartments.
        Low stress fish characterised by low background levels of the stress hormone
        cortisol had higher activity levels and entered both rewarded and unrewarded
        rooms frequently. Within the first week of exposure, however, their preference
        for the rewarded room increased, indicative of learning. Fish that had high
        background levels of cortisol, in contrast, showed low levels of activity
        but when they chose between the two rooms they chose the rewarded room most
        often but showed less improvement over time. After 12 days in the apparatus,
        both low and high stress fish had similar ratios of rewarded vs unrewarded
        room entrances. Our results suggest that proactive coping styles may increase
        exposure to novel contexts and thus favour faster learning but at the cost

        addition to hypopigmentation of the skin and red iris colouration, albino
        animals also display distinct physiological and behavioural alterations. However,
        information on the social interactions of albino animals is rare and has mostly
        been limited to specially bred strains of albino rodents and animals from
        unique environments in caves. Differentiating between the effects of albinism
        and domestication on behaviour in rodents can be difficult, and social behaviour
        in cave fish changes according to species-specific adaptations to conditions
        of permanent darkness. The agonistic behaviours of albino offspring of pigmented
        parents have yet to be described. In this study, we observed agonistic behaviour
        in albino and pigmented juvenile<jats:italic>Silurus glanis<\/jats:italic>catfish.
        We found that the total number of aggressive interactions was lower in albinos
        than in pigmented catfish. The distance between conspecifics was also analysed,
        and albinos showed a tendency towards greater separation from their same-coloured
        conspecifics compared with pigmented catfish. These results demonstrate that
        albinism can be associated with lower aggressiveness and with reduced shoaling

        the spread of sushi restaurants in the European Union and United States is
        a relatively new phenomenon, they have rapidly become among the most popular
        food services globally. Recent studies indicate that they can be associated
        with very high levels (&gt;70%) of fish species substitution. Based on indications
        that the European seafood retail sector may currently be under better control
        than its North American counterpart, here we investigated levels of seafood
        labelling accuracy in sushi bars and restaurants across England. We used the
        COI barcoding gene to screen samples of tuna, eel, and a variety of other
        products characterised by less visually distinctive \u2018white flesh\u2019.
        Moderate levels of substitution were found (10%), significantly lower than
        observed in North America, which lends support to the argument that public
        awareness, policy and governance of seafood labels is more effective in the
        European Union. Nevertheless, the results highlight that current labelling
        practice in UK restaurants lags behind the level of detail implemented in
        the retail sector, which hinders consumer choice, with potentially damaging
        economic, health and environmental consequences. Specifically, critically
        endangered species of tuna and eel continue to be sold without adequate information
        to consumers.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.1891","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,31]],"date-time":"2016-03-31T11:02:28Z","timestamp":1459422148000},"page":"e1891","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":7,"title":["Sushi

        disturbances can cause rapid degradation of coral reef communities, but what
        baseline changes in species assemblages occur on undisturbed reefs through
        time? We surveyed live coral cover, reef fish abundance and fish species richness
        in 1997 and again in 2007 on 47 fringing patch reefs of varying size and depth
        at Mersa Bareika, Ras Mohammed National Park, Egypt. No major human or natural
        disturbance event occurred between these two survey periods in this remote
        protected area. In the absence of large disturbances, we found that live coral
        cover, reef fish abundance and fish species richness did not differ in 1997
        compared to 2007. Fish abundance and species richness on patches was largely
        related to the presence of shelters (caves and\/or holes), live coral cover
        and patch size (volume). The presence of the ectoparasite-eating cleaner wrasse,<jats:italic>Labroides
        dimidiatus<\/jats:italic>, was also positively related to fish species richness.
        Our results underscore the importance of physical reef characteristics, such
        as patch size and shelter availability, in addition to biotic characteristics,
        such as live coral cover and cleaner wrasse abundance, in supporting reef
        fish species richness and abundance through time in a relatively undisturbed

        ecological information is critical as a sound basis for spatial management
        and conservation and as support for ongoing research in relatively unstudied
        areas. We conducted visual surveys of fish and benthic communities on nine
        reefs (3\u201324 km from shore) in the Thuwal area of the central Saudi Arabian
        Red Sea. Fish biomass increased with increasing distance from shore, but was
        generally low compared to reefs experiencing minimal human influence around
        the world. All reefs had a herbivore-dominated trophic structure and few top
        predators, such as sharks, jacks, or large groupers. Coral cover was considerably
        lower on inshore reefs, likely due to a 2010 bleaching event. Community analyses
        showed inshore reefs to be characterized by turf algae, slower-growing corals,
        lower herbivore diversity, and highly abundant turf-farming damselfishes.
        Offshore reefs had more planktivorous fishes, a more diverse herbivore assemblage,
        and faster-growing corals<jats:italic>.<\/jats:italic> All reefs appear to
        be impacted by overfishing, and inshore reefs seem more vulnerable to thermal
        bleaching. The study provides a description of the spatial variation in biomass
        and community structure in the central Saudi Arabian Red Sea and provides
        a basis for spatial prioritization and subsequent marine protected area design

        programming. The live-bearing fish <jats:italic>Xiphophorus multilineatus<\/jats:italic>
        has the potential to be a new model for understanding these mechanisms, given
        prior evidence of nutritional programming influencing behavior and juvenile

        the genetically influenced size classes of males. Males stop growing at sexual
        maturity, and the size classes of can be identified based on phenotypes (adult
        size and pigment patterns). To study the molecular signatures of nutritional
        programming, we assembled a <jats:italic>de novo<\/jats:italic> transcriptome

        In addition, there were significant interactions between the genetically influenced
        size classes and the environments that influenced energy intake and energy
        expenditure, with males from one of the four size classes (Y-II) responding
        in the opposite direction as compared to the other males examined. When we
        compared the brains of males of the Y-II size class reared in a low quality

        is one of the key factors governing patterns in natural systems, and adjustments
        of prey behaviors in response to a predator stimulus can have important ecological
        implications for wild fish. To investigate the effects of predators on the
        behavior of prey fish and to test whether the possible effects varied with
        predator size, black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus) and snakehead (Channa argus)
        (a size-matched predator treatment with a similar body size to prey fish and
        a larger predator treatment with approximately 2.7 times of the body mass
        of prey fish) were selected to function as prey and predator, respectively.
        Their spontaneous activities were videorecorded in a central circular arena
        surrounded by a ring holding the stimulus fish. The distance between prey
        and predator fish was approximately 200% of the distance between two prey
        fish, which suggested that black carp can distinguish their conspecifics from
        heterospecifics and probably recognize the snakehead as a potential predator.
        The prey fish spent substantially less time moving and exhibited an overall
        shorter total distance of movement after the size-matched or large predator
        was introduced, which possibly occurred due to increased vigilance or efforts
        to reduce the possibility of detection by potential predators. However, there
        was no significant difference in either distance or spontaneous activities
        between two predator treatments. These findings suggested that (1) an anti-predator
        strategy in black carp might involve maintaining a safe distance, decreasing
        activity and possibly increased vigilance and that (2) the behaviors of prey
        response to predators were not influenced by their relative size difference.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.3222","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,4,20]],"date-time":"2017-04-20T08:11:51Z","timestamp":1492675911000},"page":"e3222","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The

        lionfish are assumed to significantly affect Caribbean reef fish communities.
        However, evidence of lionfish effects on native reef fishes is based on uncontrolled
        observational studies or small-scale, unrepresentative experiments, with findings
        ranging from no effect to large effects on prey density and richness. Moreover,
        whether lionfish affect populations and communities of native reef fishes
        at larger, management-relevant scales is unknown. The purpose of this study
        was to assess the effects of lionfish on coral reef prey fish communities
        in a natural complex reef system. We quantified lionfish and the density,
        richness, and composition of native prey fishes (0\u201310 cm total length)
        at sixteen reefs along \u223c250 km of the Belize Barrier Reef from 2009 to
        2013. Lionfish invaded our study sites during this four-year longitudinal
        study, thus our sampling included fish community structure before and after
        our sites were invaded, i.e., we employed a modified BACI design. We found
        no evidence that lionfish measurably affected the density, richness, or composition
        of prey fishes. It is possible that higher lionfish densities are necessary
        to detect an effect of lionfish on prey populations at this relatively large
        spatial scale. Alternatively, negative effects of lionfish on prey could be
        small, essentially undetectable, and ecologically insignificant at our study
        sites. Other factors that influence the dynamics of reef fish populations
        including reef complexity, resource availability, recruitment, predation,
        and fishing could swamp any effects of lionfish on prey populations.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.3270","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,25]],"date-time":"2017-05-25T08:03:11Z","timestamp":1495699391000},"page":"e3270","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Invasive

        the worldwide trend of coral reef degeneration is a major challenge for the
        scientific community. A crucial management approach to minimizing stress effects
        on healthy reefs and helping the recovery of disturbed reefs is reef protection.
        However, the current rapid decline of the world\u2019s reefs suggests that
        protection might be insufficient as a viable stand-alone management approach
        for some reefs. We thus suggest that the ecological restoration of coral reefs
        (CRR) should be considered as a valid component of coral reef management,
        in addition to protection, if the applied method is economically applicable
        and scalable. This theoretical study examines the potential applicability
        and outcomes of restocking grazers as a restoration tool for coral reef recovery\u2014a
        tool that has not been applied so far in reef restoration projects. We studied
        the effect of restocking grazing fish as a restoration method using a mathematical
        model of degrading reefs, and analyzed the financial outcomes of the restocking
        intervention. The results suggest that applying this restoration method, in
        addition to protection, can facilitate reef recovery. Moreover, our analysis
        suggests that the restocking approach almost always becomes profitable within
        several years. Considering the relatively low cost of this restoration approach
        and the feasibility of mass production of herbivorous fish, we suggest that
        this approach should be considered and examined as an additional viable restoration
        tool for coral reefs.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.1732","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,29]],"date-time":"2016-02-29T08:57:38Z","timestamp":1456736258000},"page":"e1732","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["Potential
