        science ontologies play an important role in Semantic Web. Given the diversity
        in fish species and the associated wealth of information, it is imperative
        to develop an ontology capable of linking and integrating this information
        in an automated fashion. As such, we introduce the Fish Ontology (FO), an
        automated classification architecture of existing fish taxa which provides
        taxonomic information on unknown fish based on metadata restrictions. It is
        designed to support knowledge discovery, provide semantic annotation of fish
        and fisheries resources, data integration, and information retrieval. Automated
        classification for unknown specimens is a unique feature that currently does
        not appear to exist in other known ontologies. Examples of automated classification
        for major groups of fish are demonstrated, showing the inferred information
        by introducing several restrictions at the species or specimen level. The
        current version of FO has 1,830 classes, includes widely used fisheries terminology,
        and models major aspects of fish taxonomy, grouping, and character. With more
        than 30,000 known fish species globally, the FO will be an indispensable tool
        for fish scientists and other interested\u00a0users.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.3811","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,15]],"date-time":"2017-09-15T08:06:53Z","timestamp":1505462813000},"page":"e3811","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Fish

        grazing strongly controls periphyton biomass. The question therefore arises
        whether benthic grazing could be used as a tool to reduce excessive growth
        of periphyton in nutrient-enriched rivers. Although benthic invertebrate grazers
        reduce the growth of periphyton, this is highly context dependent. Here we
        assessed whether the only obligate herbivorous fish in European rivers, the
        common nase (<jats:italic>Chondrostoma nasus<\/jats:italic> L.), is able to
        reduce periphyton biomass in a eutrophic river. We conducted three consecutive
        <jats:italic>in situ<\/jats:italic> experiments at low, intermediate and high
        densities of nase in the river using standard tiles on the river bottom naturally
        covered with periphyton that were accessible to fish and tiles that excluded
        fish foraging with electric exclosures. The biomass of benthic invertebrate
        grazers was very low relative to nase. We hypothesised that nase would reduce
        periphyton biomass on accessible tiles and therefore expected higher periphyton
        biomass on the exclosure tiles, at least at intermediate and high densities
        of nase in the river. Contrary to our expectation, the impact of fish grazing
        was low even at high fish density, as judged by the significantly lower chlorophyll
        <jats:italic>a<\/jats:italic> concentration on exclosure tiles even though
        the ash-free dry mass on accessible and exclosure tiles did not differ. The
        lower chlorophyll <jats:italic>a<\/jats:italic> concentrations on exclosure
        tiles might be explained by a higher biomass of invertebrate grazers on the
        exclosure tiles, which would indicate that the effect of invertebrate grazers
        was stronger than that of herbivorous fish grazers. The high biomass of invertebrate
        grazers on exclosure tiles likely arose from the exclusion of zoobenthivorous
        fish, which occur in the river at high densities. The results of our small-scale
        experiments suggested that cascading top-down effects of zoobenthivorous fish
        have a higher impact on periphyton biomass than direct effects of herbivorous
        nase.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.4381","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,14]],"date-time":"2018-02-14T08:57:56Z","timestamp":1518598676000},"page":"e4381","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Benthic

        of fish were formed based on background blood cortisol levels and required
        to learn the location of a food reward hidden in one of two compartments.
        Low stress fish characterised by low background levels of the stress hormone
        cortisol had higher activity levels and entered both rewarded and unrewarded
        rooms frequently. Within the first week of exposure, however, their preference
        for the rewarded room increased, indicative of learning. Fish that had high
        background levels of cortisol, in contrast, showed low levels of activity
        but when they chose between the two rooms they chose the rewarded room most
        often but showed less improvement over time. After 12 days in the apparatus,
        both low and high stress fish had similar ratios of rewarded vs unrewarded
        room entrances. Our results suggest that proactive coping styles may increase

        addition to hypopigmentation of the skin and red iris colouration, albino
        animals also display distinct physiological and behavioural alterations. However,
        information on the social interactions of albino animals is rare and has mostly
        been limited to specially bred strains of albino rodents and animals from
        unique environments in caves. Differentiating between the effects of albinism
        and domestication on behaviour in rodents can be difficult, and social behaviour
        in cave fish changes according to species-specific adaptations to conditions
        of permanent darkness. The agonistic behaviours of albino offspring of pigmented
        parents have yet to be described. In this study, we observed agonistic behaviour
        in albino and pigmented juvenile<jats:italic>Silurus glanis<\/jats:italic>catfish.
        We found that the total number of aggressive interactions was lower in albinos
        than in pigmented catfish. The distance between conspecifics was also analysed,
        and albinos showed a tendency towards greater separation from their same-coloured
        conspecifics compared with pigmented catfish. These results demonstrate that
        albinism can be associated with lower aggressiveness and with reduced shoaling
        behaviour preference, as demonstrated by a tendency towards greater separation
        of albinos from conspecifics.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.1937","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,18]],"date-time":"2016-04-18T08:39:17Z","timestamp":1460968757000},"page":"e1937","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["How

        the spread of sushi restaurants in the European Union and United States is
        a relatively new phenomenon, they have rapidly become among the most popular
        food services globally. Recent studies indicate that they can be associated
        with very high levels (&gt;70%) of fish species substitution. Based on indications
        that the European seafood retail sector may currently be under better control
        than its North American counterpart, here we investigated levels of seafood
        labelling accuracy in sushi bars and restaurants across England. We used the
        COI barcoding gene to screen samples of tuna, eel, and a variety of other
        products characterised by less visually distinctive \u2018white flesh\u2019.
        Moderate levels of substitution were found (10%), significantly lower than
        observed in North America, which lends support to the argument that public
        awareness, policy and governance of seafood labels is more effective in the
        European Union. Nevertheless, the results highlight that current labelling
        practice in UK restaurants lags behind the level of detail implemented in
        the retail sector, which hinders consumer choice, with potentially damaging
        economic, health and environmental consequences. Specifically, critically
        endangered species of tuna and eel continue to be sold without adequate information
        to consumers.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.1891","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,31]],"date-time":"2016-03-31T11:02:28Z","timestamp":1459422148000},"page":"e1891","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":8,"title":["Sushi

        persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic pollutants (PBTs) are well-studied individually,
        their distribution and variability on a global scale are largely unknown,
        particularly in marine fish. Using 2,662 measurements collected from peer-reviewed
        literature spanning 1969\u20132012, we examined variability of five classes
        of PBTs, considering effects of geography, habitat, and trophic level on observed
        concentrations. While we see large-scale spatial patterning in some PBTs (chlordanes,
        polychlorinated biphenyls), habitat type and trophic level did not contribute
        to significant patterning, with the exception of mercury. We further examined
        patterns of change in PBT concentration as a function of sampling year. All
        PBTs showed significant declines in concentration levels through time, ranging
        from 15\u201330% reduction per decade across PBT groups. Despite consistent
        evidence of reductions, variation in pollutant concentration remains high,
        indicating ongoing consumer risk of exposure to fish with pollutant levels
        exceeding EPA screening values. The temporal trends indicate that mitigation
        programs are effective, but that global levels decline slowly. In order for

        have generally been identified as locations that can promote elevated productivity,
        biomass and predator biodiversity. These properties attract seamount-associated
        fisheries where elevated harvests can be obtained relative to surrounding
        areas. There exists large variation in the geological and oceanographic environment
        among the thousands of locations that fall within the broad definition of
        seamount. Global seamount surveys have revealed that not all seamounts are
        hotspots of biodiversity, and there remains a strong need to understand the
        mechanisms that underlie variation in species richness observed. We examined
        the process of fish species assembly at El Bajo Espiritu Santo (EBES) seamount
        in the Gulf of California over a five-year study period. To effectively quantify
        the relative abundance of fast-moving and schooling fishes in a \u2018blue
        water\u2019 habitat, we developed a simplified underwater visual census (UVC)
        methodology and analysis framework suitable for this setting and applicable
        to future studies in similar environments. We found correlations between seasonally
        changing community structure and variability in oceanographic conditions.
        Individual species responses to thermal habitat at EBES revealed three distinct
        assemblages, a \u2018fall assemblage\u2019 tracking warmer overall temperature,
        a \u2018spring assemblage\u2019 correlated with cooler temperature, and a
        \u2018year-round assemblage\u2019 with no significant response to temperature.
        Species richness was greatest in spring, when cool and warm water masses stratified

        ecosystems are among the most productive yet increasingly threatened marine
        ecosystems worldwide. Particularly vegetated habitats, such as eelgrass (<jats:italic>Zostera
        marina<\/jats:italic>) beds, play important roles in providing key spawning,
        nursery and foraging habitats for a wide range of fauna. To properly assess
        changes in coastal ecosystems and manage these critical habitats, it is essential
        to develop sound monitoring programs for foundation species and associated
        assemblages. Several survey methods exist, thus understanding how different
        methods perform is important for survey selection. We compared two common
        methods for surveying macrofaunal assemblages: beach seine netting and underwater
        visual census (UVC). We also tested whether assemblages in shallow nearshore
        habitats commonly sampled by beach seines are similar to those of nearby eelgrass
        beds often sampled by UVC. Among five estuaries along the Southern Gulf of
        St. Lawrence, Canada, our results suggest that the two survey methods yield
        comparable results for species richness, diversity and evenness, yet beach
        seines yield significantly higher abundance and different species composition.
        However, sampling nearshore assemblages does not represent those in eelgrass
        beds despite considerable overlap and close proximity. These results have
        important implications for how and where macrofaunal assemblages are monitored
        in coastal ecosystems. Ideally, multiple survey methods and locations should
        be combined to complement each other in assessing the entire assemblage and
        full range of changes in coastal ecosystems, thereby better informing coastal
        zone management.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.1832","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,21]],"date-time":"2016-03-21T08:39:38Z","timestamp":1458549578000},"page":"e1832","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["Comparative

        is a well-known human disease caused by anisakid larvae belonging to the genus<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova<\/jats:italic>.
        Human infection occurs after consuming infected fish. Hence the presence of<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova<\/jats:italic>larvae
        in the flesh of the fish can cause serious losses and problems for the seafood,
        fishing and fisheries industries. The accurate identification of<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova<\/jats:italic>larvae
        in fish is important, but challenging because the larval stages of a number
        of different genera, including<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova<\/jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>and<jats:italic>Pulchrascaris<\/jats:italic>,
        look similar and cannot be differentiated from each other using morphological
        criteria, hence they are all referred to as<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>larval
        type. Given that<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>larval types in seafood
        are not necessarily<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova<\/jats:italic>and may not
        be dangerous, the aim of the present study was to investigate the occurrence
        of<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>larval types in Australian marine fish
        and to determine their specific identity. A total of 137 fish belonging to
        45 species were examined.<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>larval types
        were found in 13 species, some of which were popular edible fish in Australia.
        The sequences of the first and second internal transcribed spacers (ITS-1
        and ITS-2 respectively) of the<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>larvae
        in the present study showed a high degree of similarity suggesting that they
        all belong to the same species. Due to the lack of a comparable sequence data
        of a well identified adult in the GenBank database the specific identity of<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>larval
        type in the present study remains unknown. The sequence of the ITS regions
        of the<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>larval type in the present study
        and those of<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova<\/jats:italic>spp. available in GenBank
        are significantly different, suggesting that larvae found in the present study
        do not belong to the genus<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova<\/jats:italic>, which
        is zoonotic. This study does not rule out the presence of<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova<\/jats:italic>larvae
        in Australian fish as<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova decipiens E<\/jats:italic>has
        been reported in adult form from seals in Antarctica and it is known that
        they have seasonal presence in Australian southern coasts. The genetic distinction
        of<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>larval type in the present study from<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova<\/jats:italic>spp.
        along with the presence of more species of elasmobranchs in Australian waters
        (definitive hosts of<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>spp. and<jats:italic>Pulchrascaris<\/jats:italic>spp.)
        than seals (definitive hosts of<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova<\/jats:italic>spp.)
        suggest that<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>larval type in the present
        study belong to either genus<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>or<jats:italic>Pulchrascaris<\/jats:italic>,
        which are not known to cause disease in humans. The present study provides
        essential information that could be helpful to identify Australian<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>larval
        types in future studies. Examination and characterisation of further specimens,
        especially adults of<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>and<jats:italic>Pulchrascaris<\/jats:italic>,
        is necessary to fully elucidate the identity of these larvae.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.1722","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,15]],"date-time":"2016-03-15T08:31:49Z","timestamp":1458030709000},"page":"e1722","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Occurrence
