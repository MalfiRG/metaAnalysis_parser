        science ontologies play an important role in Semantic Web. Given the diversity
        in fish species and the associated wealth of information, it is imperative
        to develop an ontology capable of linking and integrating this information
        in an automated fashion. As such, we introduce the Fish Ontology (FO), an
        automated classification architecture of existing fish taxa which provides
        taxonomic information on unknown fish based on metadata restrictions. It is
        designed to support knowledge discovery, provide semantic annotation of fish
        and fisheries resources, data integration, and information retrieval. Automated
        classification for unknown specimens is a unique feature that currently does
        not appear to exist in other known ontologies. Examples of automated classification
        for major groups of fish are demonstrated, showing the inferred information
        by introducing several restrictions at the species or specimen level. The
        current version of FO has 1,830 classes, includes widely used fisheries terminology,
        and models major aspects of fish taxonomy, grouping, and character. With more
        than 30,000 known fish species globally, the FO will be an indispensable tool
        for fish scientists and other interested\u00a0users.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.3811","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,15]],"date-time":"2017-09-15T08:06:53Z","timestamp":1505462813000},"page":"e3811","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Fish

        ecosystems are influenced simultaneously by multiple stressors. One important
        environmental stressor is aquatic pollution via wastewater treatment plant
        (WWTP) effluents. WWTP effluents may contribute to eutrophication or contain
        anthropogenic contaminants that directly and\/or indirectly influence aquatic
        wildlife. Both eutrophication and exposure to anthropogenic contaminants may
        affect the dynamics of fish-parasite systems. With this in mind, we studied
        the impact of WWTP effluents on infection of brown trout by the parasite <jats:italic>Tetracapsuloides
        bryosalmonae<\/jats:italic>, the causative agent of proliferative kidney disease
        (PKD). PKD is associated with the long-term decline of wild brown trout (<jats:italic>Salmo
        trutta<\/jats:italic>) populations in Switzerland. We investigated PKD infection
        of brown trout at two adjacent sites (\u2248400 m apart) of a Swiss river.
        The sites are similar in terms of ecology except that one site receives WWTP
        effluents. We evaluated the hypothesis that fish inhabiting the effluent site
        will show greater susceptibility to PKD in terms of prevalence and disease
        outcome. We assessed susceptibility by (i) infection prevalence, (ii) parasite
        intensity, (iii) host health in terms of pathology, and (iv) estimated apparent
        survival rate. At different time points during the study, significant differences
        between sites concerning all measured parameters were found, thus providing
        evidence of the influence of effluents on parasitic infection of fish in our
        study system. However, from these findings we cannot determine if the effluent
        has a direct influence on the fish host via altering its ability to manage
        the parasite, or indirectly on the parasite or the invertebrate host via increasing
        bryozoa (the invertebrate host) reproduction. On a final note, the WWTP adhered
        to all national guidelines and the effluent only resulted in a minor water
        quality reduction assessed via standardized methods in this study. Thus, we
        provide evidence that even a subtle decrease in water quality, resulting in
        small-scale pollution can have consequences for wildlife.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.5956","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,13]],"date-time":"2018-11-13T08:57:57Z","timestamp":1542099477000},"page":"e5956","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Do

        visual surveys (UVSs) for monitoring fish communities are preferred over fishing
        surveys in certain habitats, such as rocky or coral reefs and seagrass beds
        and are the standard monitoring tool in many cases, especially in protected
        areas. However, despite their wide application there are potential biases,
        mainly due to imperfect detectability and the behavioral responses of fish

        performance of two methods of UVSs were compared to test whether they give
        similar results in terms of fish population density, occupancy, species richness,
        and community composition. Distance sampling (line transects) and plot sampling

        transects generated significantly higher values of occupancy, species richness,

        estimates differed significantly between the two sampling methods. For secretive
        species and species avoiding the observers, the line transect method yielded
        higher estimates, as it accounted for imperfect detectability and utilized
        a larger survey area compared to the strip transect method. On the other hand,
        large-scale spatial patterns of species composition were similar for both

        is a common method to monitor environmental change in river ecosystems, a
        key advantage of biomonitoring over snap-shot physicochemical monitoring is
        that it provides a more stable, long-term insight into change that is also
        effects-based. In New Zealand, the main biomonitoring method is a macroinvertebrate
        sensitivity scoring index, with little established methods available for biomonitoring
        of fish. This study models the contemporary distribution of common freshwater
        fish and then uses those models to predict freshwater fish assemblages for
        each river reach under reference conditions. Comparison of current fish assemblages
        with those predicted in reference conditions (as observed\/expected (O\/E)
        ratios) may provide a suitable option for freshwater fish biomonitoring. Most
        of the fish communities throughout the central North Island and lower reaches
        show substantial deviation from the modelled reference community. Most of
        this deviation is explained by nutrient enrichment, followed by downstream
        barriers (i.e. dams) and loss of riparian vegetation. The presence of modelled
        introduced species had relatively little impact on the presence of the modelled
        native fish. The maps of O\/E fish assemblage may provide a rapid way to identify
        potential restoration sites.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.4890","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,28]],"date-time":"2018-05-28T07:27:25Z","timestamp":1527492445000},"page":"e4890","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Predicting

        grazing strongly controls periphyton biomass. The question therefore arises
        whether benthic grazing could be used as a tool to reduce excessive growth
        of periphyton in nutrient-enriched rivers. Although benthic invertebrate grazers
        reduce the growth of periphyton, this is highly context dependent. Here we
        assessed whether the only obligate herbivorous fish in European rivers, the
        common nase (<jats:italic>Chondrostoma nasus<\/jats:italic> L.), is able to
        reduce periphyton biomass in a eutrophic river. We conducted three consecutive
        <jats:italic>in situ<\/jats:italic> experiments at low, intermediate and high
        densities of nase in the river using standard tiles on the river bottom naturally
        covered with periphyton that were accessible to fish and tiles that excluded
        fish foraging with electric exclosures. The biomass of benthic invertebrate
        grazers was very low relative to nase. We hypothesised that nase would reduce
        periphyton biomass on accessible tiles and therefore expected higher periphyton
        biomass on the exclosure tiles, at least at intermediate and high densities
        of nase in the river. Contrary to our expectation, the impact of fish grazing
        was low even at high fish density, as judged by the significantly lower chlorophyll
        <jats:italic>a<\/jats:italic> concentration on exclosure tiles even though
        the ash-free dry mass on accessible and exclosure tiles did not differ. The
        lower chlorophyll <jats:italic>a<\/jats:italic> concentrations on exclosure
        tiles might be explained by a higher biomass of invertebrate grazers on the
        exclosure tiles, which would indicate that the effect of invertebrate grazers
        was stronger than that of herbivorous fish grazers. The high biomass of invertebrate
        grazers on exclosure tiles likely arose from the exclusion of zoobenthivorous
        fish, which occur in the river at high densities. The results of our small-scale
        experiments suggested that cascading top-down effects of zoobenthivorous fish
        have a higher impact on periphyton biomass than direct effects of herbivorous
        nase.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.4381","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,14]],"date-time":"2018-02-14T08:57:56Z","timestamp":1518598676000},"page":"e4381","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Benthic

        addition to hypopigmentation of the skin and red iris colouration, albino
        animals also display distinct physiological and behavioural alterations. However,
        information on the social interactions of albino animals is rare and has mostly
        been limited to specially bred strains of albino rodents and animals from
        unique environments in caves. Differentiating between the effects of albinism
        and domestication on behaviour in rodents can be difficult, and social behaviour
        in cave fish changes according to species-specific adaptations to conditions
        of permanent darkness. The agonistic behaviours of albino offspring of pigmented
        parents have yet to be described. In this study, we observed agonistic behaviour
        in albino and pigmented juvenile<jats:italic>Silurus glanis<\/jats:italic>catfish.
        We found that the total number of aggressive interactions was lower in albinos
        than in pigmented catfish. The distance between conspecifics was also analysed,
        and albinos showed a tendency towards greater separation from their same-coloured
        conspecifics compared with pigmented catfish. These results demonstrate that
        albinism can be associated with lower aggressiveness and with reduced shoaling
        behaviour preference, as demonstrated by a tendency towards greater separation
        of albinos from conspecifics.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.1937","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,18]],"date-time":"2016-04-18T08:39:17Z","timestamp":1460968757000},"page":"e1937","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["How

        Bay is a coastal bay of the Northern Yellow Sea, China. To investigate and
        monitor the fish resources in Rongcheng Bay, 187 specimens from 41 different
        species belonging to 28 families in nine orders were DNA-barcoded using the
        mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (<jats:italic>COI<\/jats:italic>).
        Most of the fish species could be discriminated using this COI sequence with
        the exception of <jats:italic>Cynoglossus joyneri<\/jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Cynoglossus
        lighti.<\/jats:italic> The average GC% content of the 41 fish species was
        47.3%. The average Kimura 2-parameter genetic distances within the species,
        genera, families, and orders were 0.21%, 5.28%, 21.30%, and 23.63%, respectively.
        Our results confirmed that the use of combined morphological and DNA barcoding
        identification methods facilitated fish species identification in Rongcheng
        Bay, and also established a reliable DNA barcode reference library for these
        fish. DNA barcodes will contribute to future efforts to achieve better monitoring,

        abundance estimates for species are fundamental in ecology, fisheries, and
        conservation. Consequently, predictive models able to provide reliable estimates
        for un- or poorly-surveyed locations would prove a valuable tool for management.
        Based on commonly used environmental and physical predictors, we developed
        predictive models of total fish abundance and of abundance by fish family
        for ten representative taxonomic families for the Great Barrier Reef (GBR)
        using multiple temporal scenarios. We then tested if models developed for
        the GBR (reference system) could predict fish abundances at Ningaloo Reef
        (NR; target system), i.e., if these GBR models could be successfully transferred
        to NR. Models of abundance by fish family resulted in improved performance
        (e.g., 44.1% &lt;<jats:italic>R<\/jats:italic><jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup>\u00a0&lt;\u00a050.6%
        for Acanthuridae) compared to total fish abundance (9% &lt;<jats:italic>R<\/jats:italic><jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup>\u00a0&lt;\u00a018.6%).
        However, in contrast with previous transferability obtained for similar models
        for fish species richness from the GBR to NR, transferability for these fish
        abundance models was poor. When compared with observations of fish abundance
        collected in NR, our transferability results had low validation scores (<jats:italic>R<\/jats:italic><jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup>\u00a0&lt;\u00a06%,
        <jats:italic>p<\/jats:italic>\u00a0&gt;\u00a00.05). High spatio-temporal variability
        of patterns in fish abundance at the family and population levels in both
        reef systems likely affected the transferability of these models. Inclusion
        of additional predictors with potential direct effects on abundance, such
        as local fishing effort or topographic complexity, may improve transferability
        of fish abundance models. However, observations of these local-scale predictors
        are often not available, and might thereby hinder studies on model transferability
        and its usefulness for conservation planning and management.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.4566","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,17]],"date-time":"2018-04-17T07:17:42Z","timestamp":1523949462000},"page":"e4566","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Challenges

        the spread of sushi restaurants in the European Union and United States is
        a relatively new phenomenon, they have rapidly become among the most popular
        food services globally. Recent studies indicate that they can be associated
        with very high levels (&gt;70%) of fish species substitution. Based on indications
        that the European seafood retail sector may currently be under better control
        than its North American counterpart, here we investigated levels of seafood
        labelling accuracy in sushi bars and restaurants across England. We used the
        COI barcoding gene to screen samples of tuna, eel, and a variety of other
        products characterised by less visually distinctive \u2018white flesh\u2019.
        Moderate levels of substitution were found (10%), significantly lower than
        observed in North America, which lends support to the argument that public
        awareness, policy and governance of seafood labels is more effective in the
        European Union. Nevertheless, the results highlight that current labelling
        practice in UK restaurants lags behind the level of detail implemented in
        the retail sector, which hinders consumer choice, with potentially damaging
        economic, health and environmental consequences. Specifically, critically
        endangered species of tuna and eel continue to be sold without adequate information
        to consumers.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.1891","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,31]],"date-time":"2016-03-31T11:02:28Z","timestamp":1459422148000},"page":"e1891","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":14,"title":["Sushi

        groups serve two important functions in ecology: they allow for simplification
        of ecosystem models and can aid in understanding diversity. Despite their
        important applications, there has not been a universally accepted method of
        how to define them. A common approach is to cluster species on a set of traits,
        validated through visual confirmation of resulting groups based primarily
        on expert opinion. The goal of this research is to determine a suitable procedure
        for creating and evaluating functional groups that arise from clustering nominal

        do so, we produced a species by trait matrix of 22 traits from 116 fish species
        from Tasman Bay and Golden Bay, New Zealand. Data collected from photographs
        and published literature were predominantly nominal, and a small number of
        continuous traits were discretized. Some data were missing, so the benefit
        of imputing data was assessed using four approaches on data with known missing
        values. Hierarchical clustering is utilised to search for underlying data
        structure in the data that may represent functional groups. Within this clustering
        paradigm there are a number of distance matrices and linkage methods available,
        several combinations of which we test. The resulting clusters are evaluated
        using internal metrics developed specifically for nominal clustering. This
        revealed the choice of number of clusters, distance matrix and linkage method
        greatly affected the overall within- and between- cluster variability. We
        visualise the clustering in two dimensions and the stability of clusters is
        assessed through bootstrapping.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Missing
        data imputation showed up to 90% accuracy using polytomous imputation, so
        was used to impute the real missing data. A division of the species information
        into three functional groups was the most separated, compact and stable result.
        Increasing the number of clusters increased the inconsistency of group membership,
        and selection of the appropriate distance matrix and linkage method improved
        the fit.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title>Discussion<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>We
        show that the commonly used methodologies used for the creation of functional
        groups are fraught with subjectivity, ultimately causing significant variation
        in the composition of resulting groups. Depending on the research goal dictates
        the appropriate strategy for selecting number of groups, distance matrix and

        ecological information is critical as a sound basis for spatial management
        and conservation and as support for ongoing research in relatively unstudied
        areas. We conducted visual surveys of fish and benthic communities on nine
        reefs (3\u201324 km from shore) in the Thuwal area of the central Saudi Arabian
        Red Sea. Fish biomass increased with increasing distance from shore, but was
        generally low compared to reefs experiencing minimal human influence around
        the world. All reefs had a herbivore-dominated trophic structure and few top
        predators, such as sharks, jacks, or large groupers. Coral cover was considerably
        lower on inshore reefs, likely due to a 2010 bleaching event. Community analyses
        showed inshore reefs to be characterized by turf algae, slower-growing corals,
        lower herbivore diversity, and highly abundant turf-farming damselfishes.
        Offshore reefs had more planktivorous fishes, a more diverse herbivore assemblage,
        and faster-growing corals<jats:italic>.<\/jats:italic> All reefs appear to
        be impacted by overfishing, and inshore reefs seem more vulnerable to thermal
        bleaching. The study provides a description of the spatial variation in biomass
        and community structure in the central Saudi Arabian Red Sea and provides
        a basis for spatial prioritization and subsequent marine protected area design

        biofiltration is a widely used approach for the mitigation of aquaculture
        water. In this study, we investigated the effect of mussel biofiltration on
        the communities of particle-associated bacteria and unicellular eukaryotes
        in a sea bass aquaculture in southern North Sea. We assessed the planktonic
        community changes before and after biofiltration based on the diversity of
        the 16S and 18S rRNA genes by using next generation sequencing technologies.
        Although there was no overall reduction in the operational taxonomic units
        (OTU) numbers between the control (no mussels) and the test (with mussels)
        tanks, a clear reduction in the relative abundance of the top three most dominant
        OTUs in every sampling time was observed, ranging between 2\u201328% and 16\u201382%
        for Bacteria and Eukarya, respectively. The bacterial community was dominated
        by OTUs related to phytoplankton blooms and\/or high concentrations of detritus.
        Among the eukaryotes, several fungal and parasitic groups were found. Their
        relative abundance in most cases was also reduced from the control to the
        test tanks; a similar decreasing pattern was also observed for both major
        higher taxa and functional (trophic) groups. Overall, this study showed the
        effectiveness of mussel biofiltration on the decrease of microbiota abundance
