        science ontologies play an important role in Semantic Web. Given the diversity
        in fish species and the associated wealth of information, it is imperative
        to develop an ontology capable of linking and integrating this information
        in an automated fashion. As such, we introduce the Fish Ontology (FO), an
        automated classification architecture of existing fish taxa which provides
        taxonomic information on unknown fish based on metadata restrictions. It is
        designed to support knowledge discovery, provide semantic annotation of fish
        and fisheries resources, data integration, and information retrieval. Automated
        classification for unknown specimens is a unique feature that currently does
        not appear to exist in other known ontologies. Examples of automated classification
        for major groups of fish are demonstrated, showing the inferred information
        by introducing several restrictions at the species or specimen level. The
        current version of FO has 1,830 classes, includes widely used fisheries terminology,
        and models major aspects of fish taxonomy, grouping, and character. With more
        than 30,000 known fish species globally, the FO will be an indispensable tool
        for fish scientists and other interested\u00a0users.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.3811","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,15]],"date-time":"2017-09-15T08:06:53Z","timestamp":1505462813000},"page":"e3811","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["Fish

        grazing strongly controls periphyton biomass. The question therefore arises
        whether benthic grazing could be used as a tool to reduce excessive growth
        of periphyton in nutrient-enriched rivers. Although benthic invertebrate grazers
        reduce the growth of periphyton, this is highly context dependent. Here we
        assessed whether the only obligate herbivorous fish in European rivers, the
        common nase (<jats:italic>Chondrostoma nasus<\/jats:italic> L.), is able to
        reduce periphyton biomass in a eutrophic river. We conducted three consecutive
        <jats:italic>in situ<\/jats:italic> experiments at low, intermediate and high
        densities of nase in the river using standard tiles on the river bottom naturally
        covered with periphyton that were accessible to fish and tiles that excluded
        fish foraging with electric exclosures. The biomass of benthic invertebrate
        grazers was very low relative to nase. We hypothesised that nase would reduce
        periphyton biomass on accessible tiles and therefore expected higher periphyton
        biomass on the exclosure tiles, at least at intermediate and high densities
        of nase in the river. Contrary to our expectation, the impact of fish grazing
        was low even at high fish density, as judged by the significantly lower chlorophyll
        <jats:italic>a<\/jats:italic> concentration on exclosure tiles even though
        the ash-free dry mass on accessible and exclosure tiles did not differ. The
        lower chlorophyll <jats:italic>a<\/jats:italic> concentrations on exclosure
        tiles might be explained by a higher biomass of invertebrate grazers on the
        exclosure tiles, which would indicate that the effect of invertebrate grazers
        was stronger than that of herbivorous fish grazers. The high biomass of invertebrate
        grazers on exclosure tiles likely arose from the exclusion of zoobenthivorous
        fish, which occur in the river at high densities. The results of our small-scale
        experiments suggested that cascading top-down effects of zoobenthivorous fish
        have a higher impact on periphyton biomass than direct effects of herbivorous
        nase.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.4381","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,14]],"date-time":"2018-02-14T08:57:56Z","timestamp":1518598676000},"page":"e4381","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Benthic

        visual surveys (UVSs) for monitoring fish communities are preferred over fishing
        surveys in certain habitats, such as rocky or coral reefs and seagrass beds
        and are the standard monitoring tool in many cases, especially in protected
        areas. However, despite their wide application there are potential biases,
        mainly due to imperfect detectability and the behavioral responses of fish
        to the observers.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>The
        performance of two methods of UVSs were compared to test whether they give
        similar results in terms of fish population density, occupancy, species richness,
        and community composition. Distance sampling (line transects) and plot sampling
        (strip transects) were conducted at 31 rocky reef sites in the Aegean Sea
        (Greece) using SCUBA diving.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>Line
        transects generated significantly higher values of occupancy, species richness,
        and total fish density compared to strip transects. For most species, density
        estimates differed significantly between the two sampling methods. For secretive
        species and species avoiding the observers, the line transect method yielded
        higher estimates, as it accounted for imperfect detectability and utilized
        a larger survey area compared to the strip transect method. On the other hand,
        large-scale spatial patterns of species composition were similar for both

        ecosystems are influenced simultaneously by multiple stressors. One important
        environmental stressor is aquatic pollution via wastewater treatment plant
        (WWTP) effluents. WWTP effluents may contribute to eutrophication or contain
        anthropogenic contaminants that directly and\/or indirectly influence aquatic
        wildlife. Both eutrophication and exposure to anthropogenic contaminants may
        affect the dynamics of fish-parasite systems. With this in mind, we studied
        the impact of WWTP effluents on infection of brown trout by the parasite <jats:italic>Tetracapsuloides
        bryosalmonae<\/jats:italic>, the causative agent of proliferative kidney disease
        (PKD). PKD is associated with the long-term decline of wild brown trout (<jats:italic>Salmo
        trutta<\/jats:italic>) populations in Switzerland. We investigated PKD infection
        of brown trout at two adjacent sites (\u2248400 m apart) of a Swiss river.
        The sites are similar in terms of ecology except that one site receives WWTP
        effluents. We evaluated the hypothesis that fish inhabiting the effluent site
        will show greater susceptibility to PKD in terms of prevalence and disease
        outcome. We assessed susceptibility by (i) infection prevalence, (ii) parasite
        intensity, (iii) host health in terms of pathology, and (iv) estimated apparent
        survival rate. At different time points during the study, significant differences
        between sites concerning all measured parameters were found, thus providing
        evidence of the influence of effluents on parasitic infection of fish in our
        study system. However, from these findings we cannot determine if the effluent
        has a direct influence on the fish host via altering its ability to manage
        the parasite, or indirectly on the parasite or the invertebrate host via increasing
        bryozoa (the invertebrate host) reproduction. On a final note, the WWTP adhered
        to all national guidelines and the effluent only resulted in a minor water
        quality reduction assessed via standardized methods in this study. Thus, we
        provide evidence that even a subtle decrease in water quality, resulting in
        small-scale pollution can have consequences for wildlife.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.5956","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,13]],"date-time":"2018-11-13T08:57:57Z","timestamp":1542099477000},"page":"e5956","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Do

        is a common method to monitor environmental change in river ecosystems, a
        key advantage of biomonitoring over snap-shot physicochemical monitoring is
        that it provides a more stable, long-term insight into change that is also
        effects-based. In New Zealand, the main biomonitoring method is a macroinvertebrate
        sensitivity scoring index, with little established methods available for biomonitoring
        of fish. This study models the contemporary distribution of common freshwater
        fish and then uses those models to predict freshwater fish assemblages for
        each river reach under reference conditions. Comparison of current fish assemblages
        with those predicted in reference conditions (as observed\/expected (O\/E)
        ratios) may provide a suitable option for freshwater fish biomonitoring. Most
        of the fish communities throughout the central North Island and lower reaches
        show substantial deviation from the modelled reference community. Most of
        this deviation is explained by nutrient enrichment, followed by downstream
        barriers (i.e. dams) and loss of riparian vegetation. The presence of modelled
        introduced species had relatively little impact on the presence of the modelled
        native fish. The maps of O\/E fish assemblage may provide a rapid way to identify
        potential restoration sites.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.4890","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,28]],"date-time":"2018-05-28T07:27:25Z","timestamp":1527492445000},"page":"e4890","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Predicting

        the worldwide trend of coral reef degeneration is a major challenge for the
        scientific community. A crucial management approach to minimizing stress effects
        on healthy reefs and helping the recovery of disturbed reefs is reef protection.
        However, the current rapid decline of the world\u2019s reefs suggests that
        protection might be insufficient as a viable stand-alone management approach
        for some reefs. We thus suggest that the ecological restoration of coral reefs
        (CRR) should be considered as a valid component of coral reef management,
        in addition to protection, if the applied method is economically applicable
        and scalable. This theoretical study examines the potential applicability
        and outcomes of restocking grazers as a restoration tool for coral reef recovery\u2014a
        tool that has not been applied so far in reef restoration projects. We studied
        the effect of restocking grazing fish as a restoration method using a mathematical
        model of degrading reefs, and analyzed the financial outcomes of the restocking
        intervention. The results suggest that applying this restoration method, in
        addition to protection, can facilitate reef recovery. Moreover, our analysis
        suggests that the restocking approach almost always becomes profitable within
        several years. Considering the relatively low cost of this restoration approach
        and the feasibility of mass production of herbivorous fish, we suggest that
        this approach should be considered and examined as an additional viable restoration
        tool for coral reefs.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.1732","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,29]],"date-time":"2016-02-29T08:57:38Z","timestamp":1456736258000},"page":"e1732","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":8,"title":["Potential

        is a well-known human disease caused by anisakid larvae belonging to the genus<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova<\/jats:italic>.
        Human infection occurs after consuming infected fish. Hence the presence of<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova<\/jats:italic>larvae
        in the flesh of the fish can cause serious losses and problems for the seafood,
        fishing and fisheries industries. The accurate identification of<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova<\/jats:italic>larvae
        in fish is important, but challenging because the larval stages of a number
        of different genera, including<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova<\/jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>and<jats:italic>Pulchrascaris<\/jats:italic>,
        look similar and cannot be differentiated from each other using morphological
        criteria, hence they are all referred to as<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>larval
        type. Given that<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>larval types in seafood
        are not necessarily<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova<\/jats:italic>and may not
        be dangerous, the aim of the present study was to investigate the occurrence
        of<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>larval types in Australian marine fish
        and to determine their specific identity. A total of 137 fish belonging to
        45 species were examined.<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>larval types
        were found in 13 species, some of which were popular edible fish in Australia.
        The sequences of the first and second internal transcribed spacers (ITS-1
        and ITS-2 respectively) of the<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>larvae
        in the present study showed a high degree of similarity suggesting that they
        all belong to the same species. Due to the lack of a comparable sequence data
        of a well identified adult in the GenBank database the specific identity of<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>larval
        type in the present study remains unknown. The sequence of the ITS regions
        of the<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>larval type in the present study
        and those of<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova<\/jats:italic>spp. available in GenBank
        are significantly different, suggesting that larvae found in the present study
        do not belong to the genus<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova<\/jats:italic>, which
        is zoonotic. This study does not rule out the presence of<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova<\/jats:italic>larvae
        in Australian fish as<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova decipiens E<\/jats:italic>has
        been reported in adult form from seals in Antarctica and it is known that
        they have seasonal presence in Australian southern coasts. The genetic distinction
        of<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>larval type in the present study from<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova<\/jats:italic>spp.
        along with the presence of more species of elasmobranchs in Australian waters
        (definitive hosts of<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>spp. and<jats:italic>Pulchrascaris<\/jats:italic>spp.)
        than seals (definitive hosts of<jats:italic>Pseudoterranova<\/jats:italic>spp.)
        suggest that<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>larval type in the present
        study belong to either genus<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>or<jats:italic>Pulchrascaris<\/jats:italic>,
        which are not known to cause disease in humans. The present study provides
        essential information that could be helpful to identify Australian<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>larval
        types in future studies. Examination and characterisation of further specimens,
        especially adults of<jats:italic>Terranova<\/jats:italic>and<jats:italic>Pulchrascaris<\/jats:italic>,
        is necessary to fully elucidate the identity of these larvae.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.1722","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,15]],"date-time":"2016-03-15T08:31:49Z","timestamp":1458030709000},"page":"e1722","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":10,"title":["Occurrence

        addition to hypopigmentation of the skin and red iris colouration, albino
        animals also display distinct physiological and behavioural alterations. However,
        information on the social interactions of albino animals is rare and has mostly
        been limited to specially bred strains of albino rodents and animals from
        unique environments in caves. Differentiating between the effects of albinism
        and domestication on behaviour in rodents can be difficult, and social behaviour
        in cave fish changes according to species-specific adaptations to conditions
        of permanent darkness. The agonistic behaviours of albino offspring of pigmented
        parents have yet to be described. In this study, we observed agonistic behaviour
        in albino and pigmented juvenile<jats:italic>Silurus glanis<\/jats:italic>catfish.
        We found that the total number of aggressive interactions was lower in albinos
        than in pigmented catfish. The distance between conspecifics was also analysed,
        and albinos showed a tendency towards greater separation from their same-coloured
        conspecifics compared with pigmented catfish. These results demonstrate that
        albinism can be associated with lower aggressiveness and with reduced shoaling
        behaviour preference, as demonstrated by a tendency towards greater separation
        of albinos from conspecifics.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.1937","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,18]],"date-time":"2016-04-18T08:39:17Z","timestamp":1460968757000},"page":"e1937","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":6,"title":["How

        of fish were formed based on background blood cortisol levels and required
        to learn the location of a food reward hidden in one of two compartments.
        Low stress fish characterised by low background levels of the stress hormone
        cortisol had higher activity levels and entered both rewarded and unrewarded
        rooms frequently. Within the first week of exposure, however, their preference
        for the rewarded room increased, indicative of learning. Fish that had high
        background levels of cortisol, in contrast, showed low levels of activity
        but when they chose between the two rooms they chose the rewarded room most
        often but showed less improvement over time. After 12 days in the apparatus,
        both low and high stress fish had similar ratios of rewarded vs unrewarded
        room entrances. Our results suggest that proactive coping styles may increase
        exposure to novel contexts and thus favour faster learning but at the cost

        diets were analyzed to evaluate the dynamic trophs of the fish community in
        the Churince wetland system of the Cuatro Ci\u00e9negas, where the fauna consists
        of nine species: endemic, native and introduced. In nine sampling events (between
        February 2011 and May 2014) 556 specimens of all nine species were collected.
        Stomach contents were analyzed and the Relative Importance Index (IRI) was
        calculated. The feed coefficient (Q) of the diets and the accumulated trophic
        diversity (Hk), as well as the amplitude of the trophic niche were evaluated.
        Feeding strategies in the fish community were found to be eurifagic. The main
        foods in general were insects, crustaceans, gastropods, plants and teleosts.
        According to the average linkage method, four functional trophic groups were
        defined, with no higher consumption species; nevertheless all were regulators,
        mainly invertebrates. Therefore, the chain reaction in food control was higher
        from top to bottom, meaning a downwards dietary control.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.3637","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,4]],"date-time":"2017-09-04T07:07:51Z","timestamp":1504508871000},"page":"e3637","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":8,"title":["Trophic

        in underwater visual census has always been elusive. In fact, the choice of
        sampling method and the behavioural traits of fish are two of the most important
        factors affecting bias, but they are still treated separately, which leads
        to arbitrarily chosen sampling methods. FishCensus, a two-dimensional agent-based
        model with realistic fish movement, was used to simulate problematic behavioural
        traits in SCUBA diving visual census methods and understand how sampling methodology
        affects the precision and bias of counts. Using a fixed true density of 0.3
        fish\/m<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup> and a fixed visibility of 6 m, 10 counts were
        simulated for several combinations of parameters for transects (length, width,
        speed) and point counts (radius, rotation speed, time), generating trait-specific
        heatmaps for bias and precision. In general, point counts had higher bias
        and were less precise than transects. Fish attracted to divers led to the
        highest bias, while cryptic fish had the most accurate counts. For point counts,
        increasing survey time increased bias and variability, increasing radius reduced
        bias for most traits but increased bias in the case of fish that avoid divers.
        Rotation speed did not have a significant effect in general, but it increased
        bias for fish that avoid divers. Wider and longer transects and a faster swim
        speed are beneficial when sampling mobile species, but a narrower, shorter
        transect with a slow swim is beneficial for cryptic fish.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.5378","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,30]],"date-time":"2018-07-30T08:10:56Z","timestamp":1532938256000},"page":"e5378","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Effect
